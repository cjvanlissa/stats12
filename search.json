    "section": "\n5.1 Introducing SPSS",
    "text": "5.1 Introducing SPSS\nWelcome everyone to your first lab session for Statistics 1 and 2. Today, we start working with an introduction to SPSS and we calculate a few basic descriptive statistics.\nEach lab session consists of several assignments and includes explanations on how to carry out the analyses in SPSS.\nYou can work at your own pace. If you experience any problems, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask your teacher.\nYou will receive feedback to your answers after you have submitted the practical.\nGood luck!\n\n5.1.1 Step 1\nHi there!\nDuring the lab sessions of this course you will learn how to work with the statistics program IBM SPSS (SPSS for short).\nBackground information is given throughout the exercises. We will occasionally refer to additional reading materials for this course, or other sources (e.g., youtube videos).\nIf you’re working from a student workplace, SPSS is already installed. If you’re working from your own computer, you either have to purchase SPSS, or you can use a free alternative (see Section 4) - but note that, at this point, the instruction text is still focused on SPSS so if there are any differences it will be your responsibility to figure out how to use your software.\nYour first task is to start the SPSS program. You can easily find SPSS via the Windows Start Menu. SPSS may ask about the coding: use Unicode (button to the left). Then there may be another window open that you can close. In the end you should see an empty spread sheet.\n\n5.1.2 Step 2\nNow you’ve got SPSS running, we’re ready to go!\nWe will start with a number of introductory exercises using the data file stressLAS.sav. To obtain this and other tutorial data files, download the GitBook, and open the data folder to find all files.\nOpen the file in SPSS. Proceed as follows: via the op menu follow the route: File -&gt; open -&gt; data. SPSS now opens a new window. Search for the file StressLAS.sav and open the file in SPSS.\n\n5.1.3 Step 3\nThe file contains data about a study on - you guessed it - stress.\nMore precisely, it contains data on the following variables:\n\n\nstress: Measures whether the participant experiences stress, and where the stress comes from.\n\nsmoke: Measures the smoking behavior of the participant.\n\nrelation: Whether or not the participant is involved in a long-term romantic relationship.\n\noptim: Measures how optimistic the participant is on a scale of 0 to 50.\n\nsatis: Measures of life satisfaction of the participant on a scale of 0 to 50.\n\nnegemo: The amount of negative emotions on a scale of 0 to 50.\n\n5.1.4 Step 4\nAfter opening the data file, you will see the tabs Data View and Variable View at the bottom of your screen.\nMake sure the tab Data View is selected.\nLook at the Data View and describe the data file. What do the rows represent, and what do the columns represent?\n\n5.1.5 Step 5\nNow switch to the Variable View tab.\nThe Variable View lists the variables and their properties. We will not discuss all the columns in detail, but focus on the most important ones, which includes: name, label, values, and measure.\nExplain for each of the columns name, label, values, and measure what aspect of the variable it describes. Also explain the difference between variable name and variable label.\n\n5.1.6 Step 6\nValue Labels\nFor nominal and ordinal variables we have to indicate what the scores represent; that is, we have to assign so called value labels. Value labels are specified under Values.\nIf you click on values for the variable of interest, and then on the blue button with the three dots on the right, SPSS opens a new window that allows you to view, define, or modify the value labels.\nWhat are the value labels for the Stress and what are they for Smoke?\n\n5.1.7 Step 6a\nYou may have noticed that the value labels are missing for the nominal variable Relation.\nAdd the value labels yourself in SPSS such that a score 1 represents “Single” and 2 represents “In a relationship”.\n\n5.1.8 Step 7\nEvery variable has a so-called Measurement Level.\nFirst, summarize the measurement levels in your own words (as if you have to explain it to a fellow student). Then, indicate the measurement level for each of the variables of interest (Stress, Smoking, etc.).\n\n5.1.9 Step 8\nCongratulations, you have completed your first assignment!\nBefore we proceed make sure that you save the data file (via file &gt; save). Because you changed the data, it is important to save the file under a different name. This way, you don’t risk losing the original data.\nIn the next assignment we will generate descriptive statistics for this data.",

    "text": "5.2 Plotting data\n\n5.2.1 Step 1\nThe first step in any statistical analysis involves inspection of the data at hand by means of descriptive statistics and/or graphical summaries. Descriptive statistics include the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value. Examples of graphical summaries are bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.\nIn this assignment we will look at graphical summaries. In particular, we will look at three: bar charts, histogram, and scatter plots.\nYou may use the same data file as for the previous assignments.\n\n5.2.2 Step 2\nFirst, we will create a bar chart for Stress.\nProceed as follows:\nGraphs &gt; legacy dialogs &gt; bar Select Simple and click on define Select Stress under Category Axis (i.e., the variable at the x-axis) Then Click on OK and consult the graph in the output\n\n5.2.3 Step 3\nYou may have noticed that SPSS by default creates a bar chart with the observed frequency depicted on the y-axis. We will now create a new bar chart and instead ask SPSS to show the percentages on the y-axis.\nProceed as follows:\nGraphs &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Bar Again choose Simple and click on Define Under “Bars represent” choose “% of cases” Click on OK. SPSS will now create a bar chart, where the heights of the bars represent percentages.\n\n5.2.4 Step 4\nNext, we will create a histogram for Negative Emotions.\nProceed as follows:\nGraph &gt; Legacy Dialogs &gt; Histogram Select Negative Emotions under variable, and ask SPSS to Display normal curve (check the box). Click on OK.\nInvestigate the histogram; What is shown on the x-axis and what is shown on the y-axis?\nHow to read the histogram:\n\nx-axis: the scores on the negative emotions (here numbers between 0 and 50). bars represent score ranges; the more respondents with a score in that range, the higher the bar.\ny-axis: the observed number of respondents per score range.\n\n5.2.5 Step 5\nFinally, we will create a scatter plot for Negative Emotions and Life Satisfaction. Scatter plots are very useful to get a first impression of whether variables are associated.\nCreate a scatter plot as follows:\nGraphs &gt; legacy dialogs &gt; scatter/dot Choose Simple Scatter Select Negative Emotions on the x-axis, and Life Satisfaction on the y-axis Click OK\nConsult the output. Look at the scatter plot and see if you understand the graph.\nHow to read a scatter plot:\n\nx-axis represents the scores on Negative Emotions.\ny-axis represents the scores on Life Satisfaction.\nEach dot in the graph is a case, representing how the case scores on both Negative Emotions and Life Satisfaction.",

Descriptive statistics include values such as the mean, standard deviation, the maximum value and the minimum value.\nUse the same data file as for the previous assignments.\n\n5.4.2 Step 2\nWe will first take a look at the descriptive statistics for Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Negative Emotions.\nCompute descriptive statistics as follows:\nAnalyze &gt; Descriptive Statistics &gt; Descriptives\nSelect the variables Optimism, Life Satisfaction and Negative Emotions Now click on OK SPSS will open a new window - the output window - including a table with the descriptives for the selected variables.\n\n5.4.3 Step 3\nIn the previous step we computed the average value and standard deviations. However, for nominal and ordinal variables, the average value is meaningless. To explore nominal and ordinal variables we may produce Frequency tables. A frequency table shows the observed percentage for each level of the variable.\nLet’s generate a frequency table for variables Smoke and Relation.\nAnalyze &gt; Descriptive Statistics &gt; Frequencies\nSelect the variables for which you want to have the frequency distribution (i.e., Smoke and Relation) Click OK. SPSS now adds a table with the frequency distributions of the selected variables to the output file.\nNote: SPSS reports percentages and valid percentages.

Erroneous values are values that are out of range, or impossible given the variable envisaged. For example, a person may have mistyped his/her age (e.g., 511 instead of 51).\nNow it’s your task to check for each variable whether there are erroneous values (out of range values) in the file using descriptive statistics and/or graphs.\nUse the descriptive statistics to find any erroneous values.\nOne way to deal with missing values is by removing the entire case. This is not a recommended practice; however, at this point, it is the only method you have learned.\nTo find the cases that have missing values you may sort the data file on a variable with suspect values from high to low (or low to high).\nThis can be done as follows:\nData &gt; Sort Cases Select the variable on which cases should be sorted Select the cases in descending order Click on OK Go the data view and verify that the cases are now ordered.\nRemove the case(s) (i.e., delete the row from the data file) with invalid values.\n\n5.5.2 Step 5\nNow that we’ve “cleaned” the data file it’s time to answer our first research question!\nThe question is: “Are non-smokers in our sample on average more satisfied with their life than smokers?”\nTo answer this question, we need the mean of life satisfaction per smoking group. In order to generate those, we will use the Split File option in SPSS. This is an option in SPSS that allows us to get results for separate groups.\nData &gt; Split File &gt; Compare Groups Select the groups based on the variable Smoke Click OK\nNotice that you don’t see any changes in the data file or anything in the output file yet (!). However, after running the Split file command, SPSS from now will do the analyses per group, as we will see next.\nCompute the mean of Life Satisfaction (via descriptive statistics) and consult the output.\nYou may notice that SPSS provides the means of the non-smoking and smoking group separately.

It makes sense that the percentages have changed, as there are now missing values. You may have noticed that the values for Percent and Valid Percent differ. Percentage is obtained by dividing the observed frequency by the total (including respondents with a missing value). Valid Percentage is obtained by dividing the observed frequency by the number of respondents with a valid score (thus, not counting the respondents who had a missing value).\n\nImagine I have a sample of 65 participants, with 3 missing value. Of these participants, 15 reported no stress. What is the percentage of no stress, calculated by hand? \nWhat is the percentage out of valid responses (i.e., valid percent), calculated by hand? \n\nBy deleting the values we created empty cells in the data file. SPSS sees these empty cells as system missing. Some researchers instead use specific values to indicate missing values. For example, we may code missing values by 999 if the respondent refused to answer, and 998 if the respondent accidentally skipped the question. These are examples of user missing values, and we have to specify the values to be coded as missing in the Variable view.\nLet’s try this!\nGo to the Data View, and fill in 999 in the cells that have no value on the variable Stress. Then go to the variable view, look for the column ‘Missing’ and click on Missing for Stress. A new window opens. Specify 999 as a discrete missing value.

    "section": "\n5.1 Normal Distribution",
    "text": "5.1 Normal Distribution\nIn this assignment you will practice with the normal distribution.\nThe normal distribution deserves special attention as it is commonly used in statistics for the social sciences. The normal distribution was already derived in the 18 century by DeMoivre, Adrian, and also Gauss*, and since then it played a central role in statistics. More importantly, many attributes in the social sciences are by close approximation normally distributed, as was first discovered by Quetelet. Hence, the normal distribution has great empirical relevance, which comes in handy for our research!\n\nFor that reason, the normal distribution is sometimes referred to as a Gaussian curve.\n\nBefore we start, the concept of a random variable needs to be introduced first. A random variable is a numerical outcome of a chance experiment.\nFor example, a random variable is the number of pips when throwing two dice (here the chance experiment is throwing two dice). Also, the proportion of girls in a random sample of 10 children is a random variable (here the chance experiment is the random selection of 10 children).\nWe also distinguish between continuous and discrete (categorical) random variables.\nA continuous variable can take on infinitely many values. For example, the height of a person is a continuous variable. Take any two persons of different height, and we can always find a third person in between. Discrete variables can take on only particular values. For example, the number of correct of correct answers when a person blindly guesses all the answers is a discrete random variable.\n\nif you want to know, see for example Wikipedia\n\nNormal distributions are distributions for continuous random variables.\nLet’s first have another look at different examples of normal distributions:\n\n\n\nDist.\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\n1\n–1.0\n0.5\n\n\n2\n0.5\n0.5\n\n\n3\n0.5\n1.5\n\n\n4\n2.0\n1.0\n\n\n\nInspection of the graphs of the bell-shape distributions shows that it is a symmetric distribution. We also see that the distributions differ in location (the point on the x-axis where it reaches its maximum) and the spread. In other words, the distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean and standard deviation. The mean is denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) (pronounced as “moo”) and standard deviation is denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\) (pronounced as “sigma”).\nCompare the distributions and see how the parameters determine the location (mean) and spread (standard deviation).\n\n5.1.1 Quiz\n\nCorrectly complete the sentence below by filling in the gaps:\nGiven the example “A student guesses the correct answer to 10 multiple choice questions with four answer categories each” the random experiment is \nthe correct answer\nguessing the correct answer\nthe number of correct answers\nthe 4 answer categories and the random variable is \nthe correct answer\nguessing the correct answer\nthe number of correct answers\nthe 4 answer categories.\nAre the following random variables discrete or continuous?\nNumber of heads in 10 throws with a fair coin is continuous. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nTime by train from Tilburg to Eindhoven is continuous. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThe number of correct answers on a test is continuous. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThe mean height in a random sample is continuous. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThe average number of correct answers in a random sample of 100 students is continuous. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nIf the standard deviation (SD) increases, the distribution becomes \nnarrower\nwider\n\n\n5.1.2 “The Empirical Rules”\nAs a first step we may consider some practical rules for working with the normal distribution, the so called “empirical rules”. In particular, if a random variable is normally distributed the following empirical rules apply:\n68% of the values lie within one standard deviation from the mean. 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations from the mean.\nIf we know that a variable is normally distributed, we can also compute probabilities of certain outcomes, so called events. For example, if we know that the scores on a test are normally distributed, we may want to know the probability that a randomly selected person has a score above a certain cut-off (i.e., satisfies a certain selection criterion).\nIn the next few steps, you will practice on how to compute probabilities under the normal distribution. To do so, we have to be able to work with the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) and accompanying tables.\n\n5.1.3 Quiz\n\nComplete the following sentences:\nIQ scores are normally distributed with mean 100 and an SD of 15. This means that 95% of the persons in the population has an IQ in between \n85\n70\n55\n15 and \n130\n145\n115\n100.\nStudents loan after completing the bachelor is normally distributed with mean 1500 Euros and an SD of 150. This means that 68% of the students ends up with a loan between \n1000\n1200\n1485\n1350 and \n1515\n1650\n1450\n1800.\nWhat is the mean of the standard normal distribution? \nWhat is the SD of the standard normal distribution? \n\n\n5.1.4 Calculating probabilities\nFor the next series of exercises you need to use a Z-table or calculator (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, R online, or the Z-table in this GitBook, Appendix A).\nWe have seen that probabilities are related to the area under the curve. This means that for continuous variables we can only find the probability that the outcome falls within a certain interval. For example, the time to complete a task is more than 10 minutes; the IQ is in between 70 and 90.\nNote that there may be different ways to get to the correct answer.\nNumerical Examples\n\n5.1.5 Quiz\n\nConsider a continuous variable X, which is normally distributed with \\(X \\sim(\\mu = 30, \\sigma = 4)\\).\nCompute the following probabilities:\nP(X&gt;36.8): \nP(X&lt;24): \nP(X&lt;35): \nP(28&lt;X&lt;34): \n\n\nExplanation\n\nP(X&gt;36.8):\n\nTransform X into Z: (36.8 − 30)/4 = 1.7\nRead Upper Tail Area for Z = 1.7, which equals 0.0446\nConclusion: P(X&gt;36.8)= 0.0446.\n\nP(X&lt;24):\n\nTransform X into Z: (24 − 30)/4 = -1.5\nBecause the Z-distribution is symmetric, we know that P(Z&lt;−1.5) is equal to P(Z&gt;1.5). The latter probability can be found in the Z-table, which is 0.0668. This is also the probability we are looking for.\nConclusion: P(X&lt;24) = 0.0668.\n\nP(X&lt;35):\n\nThe probability we are looking for equals 1− P(X&gt;35). Thus, we first need P(X&gt;35).\nCompute corresponding Z-value: Z = = 1.25.\nLook for the upper tail area in the Z-table: P(Z&gt;1.25) = .1056.\nThus, the area we are looking for is 1 − .1056 = .8944\nConclusion: P(Z&lt;35) = 0.89444\n\nP(28&lt;X&lt;34):\n\nRemark: there are different ways to come the answer. So the answer below is just one of few possibilities.\nWe need the area under curve between 28 and 34. This area equals 1 minus the tail areas; that is, P(28&lt;X&lt;34) = 1 − P(X&lt;28) − P(X&gt;34)\nLets start with P(X&gt;34). First compute Z= = 1. Via the Z-table we find P(Z&gt;1)= .1587.\nNow determine P(X&lt;28). First compute Z= = −0.5. Via the Z-table we find P(Z&lt;−0.5) = P(Z&gt;0.5) = .3085.\nHence, we have 1 − 0.1587 − 0.3085 = 0.5328\nConclusion: P(28&lt;X&lt;34) = 0.5328.\n\n\nStudents are looking for a new roommate. They read in an article that the time people spend under the shower is in the population normally distributed with mean of 10 and SD of 8 (measured in minutes). Suppose they randomly select a person as their new roommate.\nWhat is the probability that this randomly selected person will spend more than 20 minutes under the shower? \nSuppose “confidence in society” is measured on a continuous scale from 0 (no confidence at all) to 100 (highly confident). Also suppose that confidence is normally distributed in the population with mean 52.6 and SD of 12. One speaks of low confidence if the score falls below 43.\nWhat percentage of the population has low confidence? \nThe scores on a test for aggressive behavior are normally distributed with mean 50 and SD of 10. The test is used to select police officers. In particular, only police officers with scores between 42 and 62 qualify for the job as they are not too aggressive and not too friendly either.\nWhat percentage of the population qualifies as police officer? \n\n\nExplanations\n\nLet X denote time people spend under the shower. We want to know the probability that the person showers for more than 20 minutes; that is, P(X&gt;20) given \\(\\mu\\) = 10 and \\(\\sigma\\) = 8.\nCompute Z value: (20 −10)/8 =1.25. Hence, we need P(Z&gt;1.25); that is, the area beyond Z = 1.25.\nVia the Z-table (look in the column labelled C) we find: P(Z&gt;1.25) = .1056.\nConclusion: the probability that a random selected person will shower more than 20 minutes is 0.106 (about 11%).\nLet X stands for the confidence level. X is normally distributed with mean = 52.6 and SD = 12. We need P(X&lt;43). That is, we need the area under the curve to the left of 43.\nFirst, transform to Z-scores: X=43 =&gt; Z = (43 −52.6)/12 = −0.8. Thus, we need P(Z&lt;−.8).\nThe left-tail areas are not shown in the Z-table. Therefore, to find the area, we will first look for the area in the other tail; that is, we will look for P(Z&gt;0.8) in the Z-table. The probability equals 0.2119. Because the distribution is symmetric, the left tail area is also 0.2119. This gives us the answer.\nConclusion: about 21.2% in the population has low confidence in society.\nLet X be the test scores. We need to compute P(42&lt;X&lt;62). This area can not be directly found in the Z-table, so we have to take some additional steps. First, because the whole area under the curve is 1, we can say that the area we are looking for is equal to 1 minus the areas in the tail; thus, 1 − P(X&lt;42) − P(X&gt;62). These latter probabilities can be read from the Z-table!\nCompute Z-values: 1 − P(Z&lt;−0.8) − P(Z&gt;1.2). Remember that \\(Z = \\frac{Observed-mean}{SD}\\).\nDetermine the tail areas: because the distribution is symmetric, we have P(Z&lt;−0.8)=P(Z&gt;0.8). The latter can found in Z-table, which equals .2119. Probability P(Z&gt;1.2) can be directly read from the Z-table, which is .1151.\nHence, 1 − .2119 − .1151 = 1−.327 = .673.\nConclusion: 67.3% of the population qualifies as police officer.\n\nSuppose the time to complete a certain task is normally distributed with mean 8.6 and standard deviation (SD) of 3.5.\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected person needs more than 11.4 minutes to complete the task? \nAgain, suppose the time to complete a task is normally distributed with mean 8.6 and standard deviation of 3.5.\nComplete the sentence:\n“95% of the participants completes the task within 1.6 and  minutes.”\nScores on a selection test are normally distributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 50. A person qualifies for the job if they score between 480 and 580.\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected person will qualify for the job? \nAn IT company is looking for new programmers. To qualify for the job the programmers need to score high on conscientiousness. Therefore, the job applicants need to complete the Conscientiousness scale from the NEO-PI-R (a popular personality inventory for the Big Five personality traits*) as part of the selection procedure. Research has shown that in the population the scores on the scale are normally distributed with a mean of 133.4 and SD of 18.3. To qualify for the job, the conscientiousness of the programmer needs to be among the highest 20% in the population.\nWhat cut-off should the company use to select new personnel? Round to a whole number. \n\nThe Big Five is a popular model for personality; see Wikipedia for more info on the Big Five.\n\n\n\nExplanations\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nTransform X into Z: (11.4 -8.6)/3.5 = 0.8\nRead Upper Tail Area for Z = 0.8, which equals 0.2119\nConclusion: P(X&gt;36.8)= 0.212\n\nQuestion 2:\n95% of the participants completes the task within 1.6 and 15.6 minutes. You can use the empirical rule that 95% of the observations falls within 2SDs from the mean. Thus, 95% of the observations lies within 8.6−2×3.5 and 8.6+2×3.5\nAnd 8.6+2×3.5 = 15.6\nQuestion 3:\nWe need P(480&lt;X&lt;580). This probability equals 1 − P(X&lt;480) − P(X&gt;580).\nP(X&lt;480) = P(Z&lt;−0.4) = P(Z&gt;0.4) = 0.3446 (via Z-table)\nP(X&gt;580) = P(Z&gt;1.6) = P(Z&gt;1.6) = 0.0548 (via Z-table)\nSo the final answer equals: 1−0.3446−0.0548=0.6006 (0.601 when rounded at three decimal places).\nQuestion 4:\nTo get to the correct answer, these are the steps: - First find the Z-value that marks the highest 20%. This value equals 0.84. - Then compute the corresponding cut-off on the X-scale: X = 0.84×18.3 + 133.4 = 148.772 - Rounded to the nearest integer equals 149.",

    "section": "\n5.2 Missing Values",
    "text": "5.2 Missing Values\nFor this assignment, and also later assignments, we will use a (real) data set on Type D personality and several background characteristics (age, gender, and education level (7 ordered levels)).\nType D personality is defined as the tendency towards negative affectivity (NA) (e.g., worry, irritability, gloom) and social inhibition (SI) (e.g., reticence and a lack of self-assurance). Theory suggests that Type D individuals have poorer health outcomes.\nType D is measured with the DS14 scale. The DS14 consists of 14 items, 7 measuring NA and 7 items measuring SI. Answers are given on a five point scale (scored 0 through 4).\n\nsee also Type D personality on Wikipedia.\n\nOpen the data file TypeDDataSSC.sav in SPSS. The data file contains the scores on the DS14 items measuring Type D as well as the background variables for 80 respondents.\nGo to the variable view. The content of the items are given under labels and it is indicated whether the item measures NA or SI.\n\n5.2.1 Quiz\n\nIs the first item in the DS14 an indicator of NA or SI? \nNA\nSI\nGo to the data view in SPSS and inspect the data.\nDo you see any missings? \nYes\nNo\nWhat is the valid N of the variable age? \nHow many system missings do we have on gender? \n\n\n5.2.2 Recoding missing values\nRemember that Empty cells are called system missings. There are reasons to use user-specified missing codes instead; for example, this allows you to keep track of reasons for missingness (which enables you to report more comprehensively on your missing data).\nSo, for this exercise we will define a user-missing code for the missing values. Missing code is number that a researcher uses to designate that the value is missing. The code must be chosen such that it cannot be confused with actual scores. For example, for age the missing code can be 999, because 999 is an impossible age.\nNow, we will first define missings for age.\nGo to the data view; look at the values of age and whenever the value is missing fill in 999. (In total three persons had a missing on age; so you have to fill in 999 three times).\nGo to the variable view. We have to define the missing code under missing. Click on the cell and […], and SPSS opens a new window. Define 999 as missing code.\nIn the previous step we filled in the missing codes manually. For a small data set this is okay, but for large data sets (say thousands of persons on many variables) this would be problematic.\nIn the next few steps we will see how we can define the missings more easily.\nTo do so, we will use the function recode in SPSS. We will first apply the recoding to gender.\nBefore going into the recoding, let’s first look at the frequency table for gender.\nYou may already have this output from answering the Quiz.\n\n5.2.3 Recode into Same Variables\nReplacing user missing values with a missing code using the recode option works as follows:\nNavigate to Transform &gt; Recode into the same variables. SPSS opens a new window.\nSelect gender as the variable to be recoded.\nClick on Old and New Values. SPSS opens a new window. In this window we can specify the recoding. In our case we want to recode System Missing into 999. So, choose “system missing” as old Value, and specify 999 as new value, and click on Add below. (See the more info section below for the SPSS specifications.)\nClick on Continue, and click on OK. SPSS now replaced system missing by 999. Go to the data view and verify that SPSS filled in 999 at the empty places.\nGo to the variable view and specify 999 as the user missing code for gender. (In the same way as you did for age).\nCompute the frequency table for gender again.\nVerify that all “system missings” are now reported as “user missings” instead.\nIn the previous step we only recoded the missings for gender, but we could do that for all variables. It is most convenient to use a code that can be used for all variables. In this case we can use 999 as the missing code for all variables, it’s easy because we can apply this recoding to all variables at once. Just follow the same steps as before, but now select all variables to recode.\nRun the recode command for all variables.\nVerify in the data file that SPSS replaced all system missings by 999.\nNow we also have to specify in the variable view that 999 is the missing codes for all variables. We already changed it for age and gender. To do the same thing for other variables is easy; you can just use copy-paste! Click on Missing for gender, click on the right mouse button, choose copy. Go to the next variable, click on the right mouse button, and with paste you can define the missings for other variables.\nTip: If you like shortcuts: you can also click on missing, type Ctrl C, and then use Ctrl V to copy the information about the missings.\nSo, we specified the missing codes, but we also want to know for each respondent how many missings values he or she had. In other words, for each participant we want to count the number of missings. Participants with too many missings may be excluded from further analysis. Counting the number of missings per person can also be easily accomplished in SPSS.\nTransform &gt; Count Values within Cases. SPSS opens a new window. Specify the name of the target variable (e.g., CountMiss); this is the name of a new variable that gives the number of missings. You may also give the variable a label, say: “Number of Missings”.\nSelect all variables.\nClick on Define Values. SPSS opens a new window. Select System or User Missing at the left and click on add. Click on continue than OK.\nSPSS will now create a new variable that shows how many missings there are for each person on the variables selected in the list.\nGo to the data view and verify that SPSS added a new variable (i.e., a new column with values) named CountMiss.\n\n5.2.4 Quiz\n\nCompute the frequency table for the third DS14 item. How many missing values do we have on this item? \nHow many missings does person 8 have, using the variable CountMiss? \nCompute the frequency table for CountMiss.\nWhat is the maximum number of missings for the participants in this dataset? \nHow many participants have this many missings? \nHow many participants have at least one missing value? \n\nMake sure you save the data file including the variable with the number of missings. We will use it in the next assignment. `",

    "section": "\n5.3 Select Cases and Split File",
    "text": "5.3 Select Cases and Split File\nIn this assignment we will take a closer look at selecting cases and how to do analyses for subgroups.\n\n5.3.1 Selecting Cases\nIn the previous assignment we have seen that some respondents had one or more missing values. Suppose we want to discard these persons in the analysis, which means that for all the remaining analyses we only want to include participants with no missings. This method of handling missing data is called listwise deletion, and it is generally considered bad practice - but it’s also easy, so we will teach it in this course. More advanced courses cover expert methods of handling missing data.\nProceed as follows:\nData &gt; Select cases. SPSS opens a new window.\nChose “If condition is satisfied” and chose ‘if’. SPSS opens a new window again.\nSpecify the condition CountMiss = 0 to select cases with no missings.\nMake sure that the output is specified as “Filter out unselected cases”. Click on OK.\nGo to the data view.\nVerify that SPSS crossed out cases with one or more missings.\nVerify that SPSS added a new variable labelled ‘filter_$’. This is filter variable indicating who is included in the analyses (value = 1) or not (value is 0). If you remove the filter variable, SPSS will use all cases again.\n\n5.3.2 Quiz\n\nWhat is the mean for the variable age of the selected group? \nWhat is the valid sample size for that mean? \n\nNow, run the selection procedue again, but remove the incomplete cases from the data file.\nProceed as follows:\nData &gt; Select cases Choose “Delete Unselected Cases” under output. Click OK. Verify that the incomplete cases are removed.\nBecause you have modified the data, it is prudent to save the new file under a different name (e.g., TypeD_selection.sav). Use this file with only the complete cases (i.e., TypeD_selection.sav) for the remaining steps.\n\n5.3.3 Split File\nSometimes we want to do analyses for subgroups, especially when exploring the data for the first time. For example, we may want to have the descriptive statistics for males and females separately. One way to do this is to use the Split File option. With this option you can tell SPSS that you want to have tables for each subgroup separately.\nLet’s see how it works!\nProceed as follows:\nVia menu follow Data &gt; split file. SPSS opens a new window.\nChoose ‘Compare Groups’ and choose gender as the variable for Groups Based on.\nClick OK.\nImportant: Notice no output appears and no changes are made to the data.

    "text": "5.4 Recode and Compute\nFor this assignment we will continue with the data on Type D and the selection of complete cases.\nBefore you start, make sure that the Split File option is disabled.\nIn practice, you often have to do some data handling before you can actually start doing analyses. For example by coding missing values, or you may have questionnaire data for which some of the questions are formulated contra-indicative and therefore should be reverse coded. Another reason would be that you may have to compute the total score (e.g., sum or average) for a set of questions.\nIn this assignment we will practice some basic data handling skills.\n\n5.4.1 Reverse Scoring Contra Indicative Items\nIf you read the item labels, you will see that the first two SI items (items DS14_1 and DS14_3 in the scale) are contra indicative. This means that for these items higher scores reflect low SI, while for other items higher scores reflect high SI. Therefore, the responses to these items should be recoded first to make sure that all items are scored in the same direction. To do so, we will create new variables that reflect the recoded items. Proceed as follows:\nTransform &gt; Recode into different Variables\nChoose DS14_1 as the Numerical Variable to be recoded\nSpecify a name for the output variable (say DS14_1R)\nGive a label, say: “SI item 1 (recoded)”\nClick on change\nDo not close the window yet, but continue to the next step…\nTo recode, we have to specify the Old Values and New values.

    "section": "\n5.5 Using Syntax",
    "text": "5.5 Using Syntax\nTo ensure that others can see exactly how you got from raw data to the final dataset used for analysis, it is essential to keep a complete record of any changes made to the data. This is also why we previously argued that you should not overwrite a datafile after altering it.\nUp until now, we ran the analyses by “click-and-point” via the menu. This is a good starting point to explore the software SPSS, but it is not good practice for professional use because there’s no record of what you did to the data in order to get your result.\nNOTE: For all your portfolio assignments, providing syntax is mandatory so I can grade what you DID, not just what you reported!\nTo keep a record of changes made to your data, you can prepare a script that contains all instructions for the analysis instead. By evaluating this script on the data, you should consistently get the same results.\n\n5.5.1 Why syntax?\nUsing syntax is important for several reasons:\n\nFirst, efficiency: it makes life easier. Once you have the syntax, you can easily redo the whole analysis without going through all the points-and-clicks again.\nSecond, communication: When you work together on research projects, it is important that you exactly understand the analyses that were done, even if you didn’t do the analyses yourself. By using syntax, all team members can see what has been done and how.\nThird, documentation & data management: As a researcher you are responsible for data storage and management (!). This not only includes storage of data, but also documentation of the all the steps and analyses you did to come to your results (e.g., handling missing values, detection of outlying values). Ideally, you should provide the materials such that other researchers can easily replicate your analyses starting from the raw data file. Working with SPSS syntax is a great way to do so.\nFourth, necessity: some statistical procedures are only available via SPSS syntax (e.g., simple effects analysis in MANOVA).\n\n\n5.5.2 Help!\nYou don’t need to memorize the commands by heart. SPSS offers help functions. If you highlight the command (e.g., statistics) and click on the button with the paper and the question mark in the top menu. SPSS opens a help file.\nUse the help function to modify the syntax such that SPSS produces a table that also reports the range (e.g., the difference between the largest and smallest value).\n\n5.5.3 How to use syntax\nThere are two ways to use syntax. The first is to create an empty syntax script via File -&gt; New -&gt; Syntax, and then start adding the code from scratch. You can either write the code as text, or create it via SPSS’ various dialog windows. For this course, we recommend using the dialogs:\n\nIn any dialog window, click “Paste” instead of “OK”.\nA new window opens (or existing window comes into focus) with a script file (or “syntax” file). The instructions for the requested analysis are added at the bottom of this file.\nSelect all instructions you wish to execute, and press the green “Play” button.\nYou can re-organize this script file, adding, or removing operations or changing their order. Keep it nice and organized!\n\n\n\nSyntax for recoding\n\nSelect the highlighted lines and press the green “Play” button. Verify in the data view that SPSS added a new variable (i.e., new column) with the recoded values for Item 1.\nSyntax is also useful because it may be more straightforward than the graphical interface. For example, the recode syntax above took a lot of pointing and clicking to get:\nRECODE DS14_1 (0=4) (1=3) (3=1) (4=0) INTO DS14_1R.\nEXECUTE.\nFor recoding more variables, we can copy-paste these instructions and change the variable names.\nFor example, to recode DS14_3 in the same way as you did the recoding for DS14_1 we would write:\nRECODE DS14_1 (0=4) (1=3) (3=1) (4=0) INTO DS14_1R.\nRECODE DS14_3 (0=4) (1=3) (3=1) (4=0) INTO DS14_3R.\nEXECUTE.\nAlternatively, we could simply say:\nCOMPUTE DS14_1R = 4-DS14_1.\nCOMPUTE DS14_3R = 4-DS14_3.\nEXECUTE.\nVerify that this calculation also works.\n\n5.5.4 Commenting\nWhen working with syntax, it is highly recommended to add comments as reminders to your future self of the purpose of each step in the script. These comments should clarify the syntax and give general information (e.g., when was the syntax last modified, who did the modifications, etc.).\nComments are text lines that start with an * and ends with a dot. Comments are printed in grey.\nREMARK: the dot at the end of your text line is really important. If you do not add it, your syntax will run work properly!\nAdd comments including the following information:\n\nWhen was the syntax made?\nWho made syntax?\nWhat does the syntax do?\n\nFor example (CJ is short for Caspar J. Van Lissa):\n* CJ: This script also recodes Likert scales with integer values.\nCOMPUTE DS14_1R = 4-DS14_1.\nCOMPUTE DS14_3R = 4-DS14_3.\nEXECUTE.\nAfter including the comments, run the complete syntax including the comment line (by selecting and running it, or via top menu Run &gt; All).\nIf the syntax runs correctly, the comments were correctly included.\n\n5.5.5 Compute Variable\nFor the analyses we are not interested in the single item scores but in the summed scores. Because the DS14 contains two subscales (consult the item labels to see to which subscale the item belongs), we want to compute the summed scores for the NA and SI items separately.\nLet’s first do this for NA. Proceed as follows:\nTransform &gt; Compute variable. SPSS opens a new window.\nChoose a name for the target variable, say: NAtotal.\nUnder numerical expression you have to say what you want to compute. In this case the sum of the NA items, which is DS14_2 + DS14_4 + … etc. So, select the first item to be summed from the list at the left, type +, select the next item you want to add, and so on. Make sure that you only add up the NA items (in the variable view you can see which items measure NA and which measure SI).\nClick Paste, and run the code.\nAlternatively, copy-paste this syntax, complete it and run it:\nCOMPUTE NAtotal = DS14_2 + DS14_4 + .\nCOMPUTE SItotal = .\nEXECUTE.\n\n5.5.6 Quiz\n\nCompute the frequency table for the recoded DS14_3 item.\nWhat percentage of the respondents had the highest score on this item? \nWhat is the mean of NAtotal? \nCompute the mean of NAtotal for men and women separately. For which group is the mean highest? (Hint: Use the skills you’ve learned in the previous assignments). \nWomen\nMen\nCompute the total scores for SI. Make sure you use the reverse scored items for items 1 and 3 to compute the total score (this implies you have to leave the original item 1 and 3 out).\nWhat is the mean of SI in the total sample? \nWhat is the mean for the subsample of men?",

Alpha is the probability of committing a Type I error (drawing a false-positive conclusion). Since we select the alpha level, it is known. If we use \\(\\alpha = .05\\), that means that - by definition - we accept a 5% risk of committing a Type I error.\nThere is also the probability of committing a Type II error. This is called \\(\\beta\\). We don’t know the value of \\(\\beta\\) beforehand, but we can calculate it if we make some assumptions. The probability of committing a Type II error (drawing a false-negative conclusion) depends on a few factors:\n\n6.1.1 How big the effect is\nBig effects are harder to miss; imagine trying to detect a difference between two groups.

Consider that a small difference between two groups would be hard to detect if the two groups overlapped very much (= high standard deviation). Look at the same picture from the previous point (sample size); it illustrates this principle. The reason that both sample size and “noise in the data” have an impact on the probability of committing a Type II error is because they are used to calculate the standard error:\n\\[\nSE_M = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]",

    "text": "6.2 Power of a Test\nThe “power” of a test is the probability that it will correctly detect a true effect of a specific size. Since \\(\\beta\\) is the probability of missing a true effect, it follows that \\(1-\\beta\\) must be the probability of detecting a true effect, or the power.\nAs explained in the previous paragraph, we must know a few pieces of information to be able to calculate \\(\\beta\\):\n\nEffect size\nSample size\nStandard deviation\n\nWhen we conduct a study, we often know the sample size and standard deviation. The effect size is unknown, but we can assume a specific effect size. Think of this as an “informative” alternative hypothesis. The standard alternative hypothesis in null-hypothesis significance testing is just “anything that’s not the null hypothesis”. So if \\(H_0: \\mu = 0\\), then \\(H_a: \\mu \\neq 0\\). Now, we must specify an exact value. For example, we could choose the smallest effect size of interest as the alternative hypothesis: Let’s say we’d be interested in a mean value of \\(\\mu = 0.2\\). Then we could set our informative alternative hypothesis as \\(H_i: \\mu = 0.2\\).\nNow we have all the information needed to calculate the power of the test. To do so, we draw two sampling distributions (see illustration below): One (in red) centered around the null hypothesis, \\(H_0: \\mu = 0\\), and one centered around the informative alternative hypothesis, \\(H_i: \\mu = 0.2\\). We find the critical value in the red distribution around the null hypothesis; remember that \\(\\alpha\\) is the 5% of probability in the right tail of the red distribution. But we can now also calculate \\(\\beta\\), the unknown probability in the tail of the blue distribution to the left of the critical value. If the informative alternative hypothesis is true, then this is the probability of failing to detect that true effect. Although this example has no numeric values, we see that the blue shaded area representing \\(\\beta\\) is slightly smaller than the red shaded area representing \\(\\alpha\\), so the probability of committing a Type II error must be less than .05, and therefore the power \\(1-\\beta\\) must be greater than 95%! If our assumptions are correct, we’d be really well able to detect a true effect of the size specified under \\(H_i\\).",

This year, we have 73 students. We’ve made some changes to the teaching material, and we hope to reach an average grade of \\(M = 6\\).\nAssume that the standard deviation this year will be the same as last year, and calculate the power of being able to detect a mean grade of \\(H_i: \\mu = 6\\) when the null hypothesis is that the mean grade is the same as last year, \\(H_0: \\mu = 5\\).\nStep 1: Calculate the SE\nWe calculate the SE as \\(SE = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{73}} = 0.18\\)\nStep 2: Calculate Critical Value\nThe critical value is the boundary that corresponds to \\(\\alpha = .05\\) in the distribution centered around \\(H_0\\). Looking at the t- or Z-table (because sample size is &gt;&gt;30), we see that this corresponds to a Z-value of about 1.64.\n\nConverting this back to a score on the grades scale, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Grade}_{\\text{critical}} = (Z_{\\text{critical}} * SE) + \\mu_{H_0} = (1.64 * 0.18) + 5 = 5.3\n\\]\nStep 3: Get Left-Tail Probability for That Value\nNow, we just need to get the left-tail probability for that critical value, in the blue distribution. Convert that critical value back to a Z-value, but now in the blue distribution which is centered around \\(\\mu_{H_i} = 6\\):\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\text{Grade}_{\\text{critical}}-\\mu_{H_i}}{SE} = \\frac{5.3 - 6}{0.18}  = -3.89\n\\]\nThis is an extremely large (negative) Z-value; it’s not even in our table. Thus, the left-tail probability \\(\\beta\\) will be tiny - \\(\\beta &lt; .01\\).\nThat means that our power to detect a true effect of 6 would be very high - \\(1-\\beta = 1-.01 = .99\\), 99%!",

To keep things simple, we assume that in the population of musicians the SD is the same as in the general population; that is, we assume that LaTeX: \\(\\sigma = 15\\).\nLet openness be the variable of interest. Let \\(\\mu_{musicians}\\) represent the mean openness in the population of musicians. The hypothesis test amounts to testing:\n\\(H0: \\mu_{musicians} = 50\\)\n\\(H1: \\mu_{musicians} \\neq 50\\)\nNow, when we do the hypothesis test, we seek for evidence against the null hypothesis. More specifically, our testing procedure starts with the assumption that H0 represents the truth and as long as we don’t have convincing evidence that our assumption is false we stick to that assumption.\nThe question is, however, when do we have convincing evidence against H0?\nFinding evidence against H0 works as follows:\nIf H0 is true, we expect mean values close to H0. And, if we observe a mean value that is much different from the value under H0, we have convincing evidence against H0. If this happens, we reject H0 as representing the truth and accept the alternative hypothesis, H1.\nHypothesis testing fits Popper’s philosophy of falsification. He introduced this well-known analogy to explain the logic of falsificationism:\n\nSuppose we assume that all Swans are white, \\(H_0: Swans = white\\)\n\nWe would then not expect to observe black ones.\nIf we do observe black swans, our initial hypothesis is called into question.\nThe number of white swans we see (= observations consistent with the hypothesis) does not provide evidence for \\(H_0\\), because there could always be a black swan out there we haven’t observed yet.\n\nSo, the next questions are:\nWhat are the sample values we can expect under H0? When is evidence “convincing” enough? To answer the first question we have to go back to sampling distributions!\nFor the second question, we need a criterion. We have to realize that even if H0 is true, sample values can be far off just by sampling fluctuations (i.e., by chance). The common criterion is: if the observed value is among the 5% most unlikely samples under H0 (i.e. if H0 is true), we reject the null hypothesis.\nLet’s go back to our example about musicians.\nLet X be openness. Under H0 we assume that X is normally distributed with mean 50 and SD equal to 15.\nWhat are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean under H0 given that the sample size is 25? And what do we call the standard deviation of the sampling distribution?\n(Use what you have learned in the previous lectures. Hint: first make a drawing of the situation, then do the computations).\n\n\nExplanation\n\nSampling distribution:\n\nMean: \\(\\mu = 50\\)\n\nStandard error ( =SD of sampling distribution!): \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{25}}= 3\\)\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to indicate sample means that are unlikely if H0 would be true. In particular, we want to know how far the sample mean must be from the hypothesized mean to be among the 5% of all possible samples under H0 that are furthest away from the hypothesized means.\nWhat should the value of the sample mean be to fall within the 5% most deviant samples if the sample size is 25?\n\n\nExplanation\n\nWe are talking about the distribution of the mean; so we need to work with the sampling distribution. We want to know the cut offs that mark the 2.5% highest and 2.5% lowest means. We first have to find the Z-values: they are 1.96 for the highest 2.5%, and (by symmetry) -1.96 marks the 2.5% lowest.\nHence, to be among the 5% of all possible sample means that are most unlikely under H0, the sample mean should be:\nlarger than 50+1.96 x 3 = 55.88 or smaller than 50-1.96 x 3 = 44.12\n\nLet’s do some more exercises on the Z-test.\nSuppose the mean for Openness we found in our sample was 59.\nIf we use a significance level of 5%, would we reject the null hypothesis? \nYes\nNo\nIn the previous step we used cut offs for the sample means to decide about significance. The cut off scores were obtained via the Z-distribution. However, doing all these computations is not necessary (there’s a shortcut!!). In fact, if we know the Z-value for the sample, we can easily find out if the sample is among the 5% of the most unlikely sample means. We only have to compare the value with 1.96 and -1.96 to see whether that is the case.\nIn this course, we will use Z-values for different purposes. In these specific calculations, Z is used as a Test Statistic. A test statistic quantifies evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, the Z test statistic expresses how far away from the mean under the null hypothesis the observed mean is, in terms of the number of standard errors.\nThe Z test-statistic follows the standard normal distribution. The values 1.96 and -1.96 are called the critical values and they mark the 5% most unlikely sample means under H0. In other words, the critical values mark the reject region for H0.\nSo, if we compute the Z-value for the sample mean, and if that sample value of Z falls in the rejection region, we reject H0 (we found something that is unlikely enough to no longer believe H0 is true). If H0 is rejected we speak of a significant result. See the graph below:\n\nFollowing these steps to test a mean is one example of performing a “Z-test”!\nWe can use the Z-test to test hypotheses about the population mean if we know the population \\(\\sigma\\).\nThe test statistic for the Z-test is:\n\\(z  = \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}\\)\nThis statistic is computed using the mean from the sample, the hypothesized mean under H0 and \\(\\sigma\\).\nH0 is rejected at the 5% significance level if z is either larger than 1.96 or smaller than -1.96.\nSo far, we rejected the null hypothesis if the sample is among the 5% most unlikely sample means under H0. This 5% was called the significance level, and is denoted as \\(\\alpha = .05\\). However, we could just as well choose 1% or .5%.\nWhat would be the critical values for the Z-test if one tests at \\(\\alpha = .01\\)? \nWhat would be the critical values for the Z-test if one tests at \\(\\alpha = .005\\%\\)? \nFor historical reasons, social scientists tend to use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as a default. So in this course, if alpha is not explicitly stated, assume \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\nWhen we test hypotheses we reject H0 if the sample we find is unlikely if H0 is true. However, the flip side is that, even though H0 is true, we may find a sample that is much different by chance, and erroneously reject H0. Or, in other words, we could make an error. Rejecting H0 while it is true in reality is called a Type I error!\nConsider the following:\n\nIf H0 is true, and you test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), what is the probability of committing a Type I error?\nWhat is the link between the \\(\\alpha\\)-level and type I error rate?\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\nIf H0 is really true (i.e., H0 should not be rejected), then the probability that the sample mean is among the 5% most unlikely is equal to 5%.\nThe alpha level specifies the risk of a Type I error. So if one tests at an alpha level of .05, it means that one accepts a risk of 5% to commit a Type I error.\n\n\nProperties of the Z-test:\nUsed to test hypotheses about the mean in a population, assuming \\(\\sigma\\) known.\nThe test-statistic equals \\(z = \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}\\)\nThe test statistic is normally distributed.",

Verify that you still have the correct predictor and outcome.\nThen, click the Plots button. You want a plot of the predicted values against the residual values, so put ZPRED in the X box and ZRESID in the Y box.\nAlso check the boxes for a Histogram and normal probability plot, then hit continue.\nNow paste and run the syntax. You should see the following added to your previous regression syntax:\n  /SCATTERPLOT=(*ZRESID ,*ZPRED)\n  /RESIDUALS HISTOGRAM(ZRESID) NORMPROB(ZRESID)\n\n9.2.3 Linearity\nHow can we test linearity using this additional output?\nFirst, we can use the “Normal P-P plot”. If the relationship is perfectly linear, all dots should be on the diagonal line. If the points are deviating from the line, the relationship is not perfectly linear. Small deviations are OK; for example, the plot below shows a linear association:\n\nDoes the P-P plot for your regression give cause for concern for violation of the assumption of linearity? \nYes\nNo\nUnclear\n\n9.2.4 Normality\nOne way to check normality is by examining the histogram of residuals. This histogram displays a normal curve by default. If the observed residuals deviate strongly from this histogram, there may be a problem.\nThe plot below shows a residual histogram with some minor deviations from normality (too few scores near the mean). This is probably still fine:\n\nDoes the residual histogram for your regression give cause for concern for violation of the assumption of normal residuals? \nYes\nNo\nUnclear\n\n9.2.5 Homoscedasticity\nWe examine homoscedasticity using a plot of standardized predicted values against standardized residuals. We want residuals to be identically distributed on the Y-axis for all values on the X-axs. In other words, this scatterplot should look like a dot cloud (no pattern) around the zero line (left picture below), and not like a pattern (right picture below).\n\nDoes the scatterplot for standardized predicted values against residual values for your regression give cause for concern for violation of the assumption of homoscedasticity? \nYes\nNo\nUnclear\nWrite up a discussion of potential violations of the assumptions for your regression, then check your answer.\n\n\nExplanation\n\nWe observed that the observed scores deviated from the P-P plot in an S-shaped pattern. We further observed that, in a histogram of standardized residuals, the observed residuals were right-skewed. Finally, we observed less variance around the regression line for low scores and more variance around the regression line for high scores.\nThese findings give cause for concern of violations of the assumptions of regression. One potential explanation is that the effect might be quadratic instead of linear. (Optional)",

    "text": "10.2 Correlation\nCorrelations and regression analyses can both be used to study the relationship between variables, but there is an important difference.\nDiscuss with your group mates what the similarities and differences between the two methods are.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nA correlation is a symmetric measure of association, meaning we are agnostic about which is the predictor and which is the outcome (or neither are predictor/outcome). The correlation between X and Y is the same as the one between Y and X.\nIn regression analysis, we do define an independent and dependent variable. The goal is to predict the outcome using the predictor. Most of the time, this implies an assumption of causality - but not necessarily.\nFor example, we can use regression to predict sales based on customer characteristics without assuming that those characteristics CAUSE sales. But if we want to cause an increase in sales, and we look at the regression coefficients to decide where to intervene - then it suddenly matters a lot whether the predictors are causes of sales or not.\nYou see this a lot with online marketing when you are receiving a lot of adds for a product that you recently bought. Their regression model knows that looking at the product page is a great predictor of intention to buy it - but they don’t know that the reason you were looking at that page is because you were already buying it.\n\nNow, let’s have a look at the correlation between these two variables.\nAnalyze &gt; correlate &gt; bivariate.\nChoose as variables: Facebook Friends and Extraversion, and click OK.\nWhat is the correlation between Extraversion and number of Facebook friends? \nSuppose three researchers test the significance of the correlation between Extraversion and Facebook friends.

This is only the case with bivariate regression.\nFurthermore, the bivariate correlation should be identical to the R reported in the Model Summary table, because they are both just the correlation coefficient. R squared is the squared correlation coefficient, and we interpret it as the “proportion of variance in the outcome explained by the predictor”. Only in bivariate regression is this identical to the squared correlation coefficient.",

In the next few steps we will look in more detail at this concept.\nConsider the results of the regression model again.\nWrite down the (unstandardized) regression equation based on your previous results, and use the raw data in the Data View to answer the following question.\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\\(\\text{pressure}_i = 37.863 -.320 * \\text{variety}_i + e_i\\)\n\nWhat is the predicted value (Y’) for emotional pressure at work for the first person in the data file (i.e., the person with respondent number 1)? \nWhat is the prediction error (a.k.a. the residual) for the first person? \nRemember Residual = Yobserved - Ypredicted\nWe’ve just computed the predicted value and error by hand. It would be very tedious if we would have to do that for all respondents. Fortunately, SPSS offers the option to compute predicted values and errors for all cases for us!\nNavigate to Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear\nClick on the ‘Save’ button. SPSS opens a new window.\nAsk for the Unstandardized predicted values and the unstandardized residuals. Paste and run the syntax.\nLet’s inspect the Data View in SPSS again and verify that SPSS added two columns in the data file. One column is labeled PRE_1 and the other RES_1. These columns show the predicted values and residuals for each person, respectively.\nYou may verify this for the first person (i.e., the values should be the same as you computed in the previous steps).\nNow we will look at the variance of the observed values of Pleasure at work, the variance of the predicted values of pleasure at work, and variance of the residuals.\nCompute the variances of Emotional pressure, as well as for the predicted values of Emotional pressure, and for the residuals.\nNavigate to Analyze &gt; Descriptive statistics &gt; Descriptives Select scemoti, PRE_1, and RES_1. Click on ‘options’ and ask for the Variance. Paste and run the syntax.\nHow large is the variance of the observed scores for Emotional pressure? \nHow large is the variance of predicted values of Work pleasure? \nHow large is the variance of the residuals? \nIn the previous questions, we looked at three variance components.\nDiscuss with your group what the three variances represent.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe variance in observed values of Emotional pressure is the total variance in Y (i.e., the dependent variable). The variance in the predicted values of Emotional pressure reflects “differences in emotional pressure that can be explained because some persons have a job with a lot of variety and some have a monotonous job”. This variance component is also known as the explained variance. The variance of the residuals, also known as the residual variance, represents differences in emotional pressure that cannot be attributed to differences in variety at work. Hence, the residual describes differences that are unrelated to variety at work.\n\nIn the previous step, we looked at the variances itself, but the numbers are not very informative. A more convenient way to look at the explained variance is proportion wise.\nSo, let’s use the variances we just generated to calculate the proportion of variance in Emotional pressure that can be explained by Variety at work.\nWhat percentage of the total variance in emotional pressure can be explained by variety at work? \nConsult the output of the regression analysis again, particularly the table Model Summary.\nVerify that the R-square that is reported in the table is the same as the proportion of explained variance that you have calculated yourself.\nFinally, independently go through all the steps of a simple regression analysis using the data file LAS_SS_Work.sav.\nYour theory suggests that independence at work predicts emotional pressure.\n\nConstruct an appropriate research question and hypotheses.\nConduct the analysis\nDescribe the relationship (i.e., regression coefficient)?\nDiscuss the effect size in terms of R2.\nPerform a significance test and report your results\n\nFinally, compare the standardized regression coefficient to the R coefficient in the Model Summary table, and optionally to a correlation computed via the Correlation interface.

To test the difference between two sample means, we will use the t-test for independent samples.\nWhat is the null hypothesis of this test?

What’s the practical use of the outcome of this test?\n\n\nExplanation\n\nLevene’s test is not significant. Remember that the null hypothesis of Levene’s test is that the population variances of the group are equal. As the p-value is not significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Consequently, there is no evidence that the population variances of two groups are unequal. Thus, there is no reason to question the assumption.\n\nNow you will have to decide on the outcome of the actual t-test. SPSS reports two versions: one that assumes equal variances (top row) and one that relaxes this assumption (bottom row).\nYou should pick one of these. In principle, you should decide which one you will use before seeing the results - although if there is clear evidence of violation of assumptions, you might want to discuss in your report whether the results change if you use the robust version (bottom row).\nFor now remember: we assume equal variances.\nWhat is the two-sided p-value? \nDo you reject the null hypothesis of this t-test at alpha 0.05? \nYes\nNo",

    "text": "12.1 ANOVA\nFor this assignment, we will use the data file 5groups.sav Download 5groups.sav. Please open it in SPSS.\nAs you have seen in the previous assignments, this file contains the measurements of the y variable for 5 different groups. So far, we have - at most - compared two groups at once. This time, we will compare the means of all 5 groups simultaneously using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).\nANOVA is often used to examine the results of experimental research where different groups receive different manipulations of an independent variable, and a continuous dependent variable is measured. In that case, rejecting the null hypothesis indicates a causal effect of the manipulated independent variable on the dependent variable.\nLet’s say the 5 groups in our data file have received 5 different types of training, and the dependent variable y measures the effect of the training.\nWe will now perform an ANOVA to see if these trainings have an equal effectiveness.\nThe null hypothesis of the ANOVA with 5 groups is as follows:\n\\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\mu_4 = \\mu_5\\)\nThat is, the null hypothesis states that the population means of all five groups are the same. Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that at least one one of these means is different from the rest.\nLet’s run the analysis!\nNavigate to Analyze &gt; General Linear Model &gt; Univariate. Choose y as the dependent variable. Choose group as the fixed factor. Now click on the “Options” button and check the two boxes named “Descriptive statistics” and “Homogeneity tests”. Finally, click “Paste” to paste the syntax into the syntax editor, and run it from there.\nYou should end up with the following syntax:\n    UNIANOVA y BY group\n      /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)\n      /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE\n      /PRINT=HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE\n      /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)\n      /DESIGN=group.\nThe first table in the output we will inspect is the “Descriptive Statistics” table. This table displays the means and standard deviations of the variable y for each of the five groups.\nDo you think the population standard deviations are different for each group? If they are, why could that pose a problem for our analysis?\nOne of the assumptions of ANOVA is homoscedasticity. In this case, that means that the population of each group has the same variance (and hence, the same standard deviation). This assumption is also called “homogeneity of variance” (= translation of homoscedasticity). Of course the variance in each sample will differ somewhat. If these differences are significant, there is evidence to doubt our assumption. That’s why we asked SPSS to perform “Homogeneity tests”.\nNote that the SD’s of groups 1 and 2 are quite different from the SD’s of groups 3, 4, 5.\nThe next table shows the output of Levene’s test. You might remember using Levene’s test for comparing the variances of two groups in the context of the independent samples t-test. This time, it tests whether the variance of all 5 groups should be considered equal.\nIs there a reason to doubt the assumption of homoscedasticity based on Levene’s test? Note: Use the Levene’s test “Based on mean”. mcq(c(answer = \"Yes\", \"No\"))\nIf Levene’s test is significant, there is evidence that the population variances of at least 2 of the groups differ. This is evidence against our assumption. This could pose a problem for our analysis. We may choose to use a version of the analysis that is robust to violations of this assumption instead, but that makes our analysis dependent on the data (= no longer confirmatory). Instead, we could discuss the violation, and compare results with and without a robust test.\nFor now, we continue with interpreting the output of the final table. There’s a lot of information, but for now we are only interested in the Sig. value of the “Corrected Model” in the first row. This is the two-sided p-value we can use to test our null hypothesis.\nWhat is the two-sided p-value? Do you reject the null hypothesis? What does that mean?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe p-value is &lt;.001. This is smaller than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, which was: \\(H_0: \\mu1=\\mu2=\\mu3=\\mu4=\\mu5\\)\nThis means that the means of at least two groups are different. Note that we do not yet know for which groups the means differ!\n\nFinally, there’s an interesting nugget of information below the final table. It’s called R Squared. This shows the total amount of variance in y that is explained by group membership.\nWhat is the value of R Squared? \nBy rule of thumb, what is the magnitude of this value (small, medium, or large)?\nCohen (1988) proposed the following guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of R2:\n\n\nSize\nR2\n\n\n\nSmall\n0.01\n\n\nMedium\n0.06\n\n\nLarge\n0.138",

The treatment that each person received from the guide is recorded in the variable behavior.\nThe dependent variable of this experiment is feeling. Higher scores on this variable indicate a more positive attitude of a participant towards the guide. In this assignment, we will use ANOVA to determine whether the mean score on the dependent variable differs between the five experimental conditions.\nWhat type of design do we use for this experiment? \nCombination of the two\nBetween-subjects design\nWithin-subjects design\nAs you will have noticed, the data file contains a third variable named weather, which can be either good or bad. For now, we will only look at the results obtained during good weather. Hence, we will use “Select cases” to select only those participants with a value of 1 on the weather variable.\nClick Data &gt; Select Cases and select “If condition is satisfied” and click the “If”-button. Now enter the following condition into the equation box:\nweather = 1\nNow click “Continue” and “Paste” to paste the resulting syntax into the syntax editor. Select Run &gt; All to run it.\nVerify that half of the participants have been crossed out in the Data View.\nWe are now ready to perform an ANOVA with the 50 remaining participants.\nTo run an ANOVA in SPSS there are multiple options. We will use the module “General Linear Model”, which encompasses ANOVA and all of its extensions which we will discuss later on (factorial ANOVA, ANCOVA, and repeated measurements).\nAnyway, let’s first create the basic syntax.\nAnalyze &gt; General Linear Model &gt; Univariate Choose feeling as the dependent variable and behavior as the fixed factor Click on the “Options” button and check the two boxes named “Descriptive” and “Homogeneity tests”. After clicking “Paste” you should get the following syntax:\nUNIANOVA feeling BY behavior    \n    /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)   \n    /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE   \n    /PRINT=DESCRIPTIVE HOMOGENEITY    \n    /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)   \n    /DESIGN=behavior.   \nWhat is the p-value of the Levene’s test? Use the Levene’s test “Based on mean” again. \nDo we have reason to question the assumption of equal population variances? \nYes\nNo\nIn ANOVA, we distinguish between three sources of variation: the Sums of Squares total (SSt), the Sums of Squares between (SSb, or SSR) and the Sums of Squares within (SSw, or SSE).\nWhat does the Sum of squares total mean (phrase your answer in your own words)? Look up the value of the SSt in the ANOVA output and write it down as well.\nWhat does the Sum of squares between entail (phrase your answer in your own words)? Look up the value of the SSb in the ANOVA output, and write it down as well.\nWhat does the Sums of squares within entail (phrase your answer in your own words)? Look up the value of the SSw in the ANOVA output, and write it down as well.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe Between Groups Sum of squares or SSb is equal to 18.330 and simply give the squared distance of individual scores to the mean, summed together. In other words, it shows how much variability there is in the group means. If all group means would be equal to each other, the SSb equals 0.\nThe SSw here is 38.405. It tells us how much the individual scores within a group deviate from the group mean. In other words, it shows how much variability there is within the groups. The is the variation that is independent from the experimental effect (because variation within groups cannot be caused by differences in experimental conditions).\nThe SSt tells us how much the invidual scores deviate from the grand mean. In other words, it shows how much variability there is in the dependent variable in total.\nRecall that SSB is the same as SSR; it can be found in the row “Corrected Model”, column Type III Sums of Squares.\nRecall that the SSW is the same as SSE; it islabeled “Error” in the column Type III Sums of Squares.\n\nHow do we use the different types of Sum of Squares to calculate the F statistic?\n\n(SSB)/(SSW)(SSB/dfb)/(SSW/dfw)(SSW/dfw)/(SSB/dfb)(SSW)/(SSB)\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe can calculate F using the following formula:\n\\(F = \\frac{MSb}{MSw}\\)\nThe MSb and MSw give the between group variance and within group variance, respectively. They can be calculated using the following formula’s:\n\\(MSb = \\frac{SSb}{k-1}\\), \\(MSw = \\frac{SSw}{N-k}\\)\n\nAgain, consider the table Tests of Between Subjects, which represents the results of ANOVA.\nWhat is the F-value of the ANOVA? \nThe degrees of freedom between (dfb) are  and the degrees of freedom within (dfw) are .\ndfb = k-1\ndfw = N-k\nAgain consider the table Tests of Between Subjects\nWhat is the p-value of the ANOVA? \nYou can find the p-value of the ANOVA in the table named “Tests of Between-Subjects Effects”. The p-value is equal to the Sig.-value in the first row of this table.\nWhat can you conclude from this?\nWrite down a statistical conclusion and a conclusion within the context of this research example.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe p-value is smaller than our alpha level (0.05). Therefore, we can conclude that there was a statistically significant difference in positive attitude between the groups, based on the behaviour the guide displayed towards them, (F(4,45) = 5.369, p = .001).\n\nWhat is the proportion of variance explained by behavior? \nHow would you describe this number in words? So what does it mean?\nRemark: Cohen formulated some rules of thumb for interpreting the \\(R^2\\) How would you qualify the strength of the effect based on Cohen’s rules of thumb? And why should we not take the rules of thumb too seriously?\nCohen (1988) proposed the following guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of \\(R^2\\)\n\n\nSize\n\\(R^2\\)\n\n\n\nSmall\n0.01\n\n\nMedium\n0.06\n\n\nLarge\n0.14\n\n\n\nNote that, in ANOVA, \\(R^2\\) is also called \\(\\eta^2\\) (eta squared) is a measure of effect size, it indicates the amount of variance in thedependen t variable that is explained by the independent variable(s). In our case, 32.3% of the variance in feeling is explained by behaviour. According to Cohen’s guidelines this is a large effect size (see slide 28). However, these guidelines are rather arbitrary, which Cohen himself also stresses.\nThe correct conclusion so far is that the five groups differ significantly on the dependent variable feeling. However, we do not yet know which groups differ.",

    "text": "9.1 Multiple regression\nMultiple regression is a statistical technique that allows us to examine the relationship between one outcome and multiple predictors. It extends the concept of bivariate linear regression, where we model the relationship between two variables, to include more predictors. In the context of social science research, multiple regression helps us answer the question: What is the unique effect of one predictor, while controlling for the effects of all other predictors?\nAs a matter of fact, last week’s analyses for categorical variables with more than two categories were already an example of multiple regression. We included two dummy variables to represent a categorical variable with three categories. All that’s new today is that we also consider the case where the multiple predictors are continuous variables. An important realization is that a regression model can be expanded to include as many predictors as needed. The general formula for multiple regression is \\(\\hat{Y} = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \\ldots + b_KX_K\\), where \\(\\hat{Y}\\) represents the predicted value of the dependent variable Y, \\(a\\) is the intercept, and \\(b_{1 \\ldots K}\\) are the slopes for each predictor.\nWhen interpreting the regression coefficients, the intercept (a) represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all predictors are equal to 0. For dummy variables, this is the mean value of the reference category, while for continuous predictors, it represents the expected value for someone who scores 0 on all predictors. The regression coefficients (b1, b2, …, bK) indicate how many units the dependent variable Y is expected to change when the corresponding predictor X increases by 1 unit, while holding all other predictors constant.\nCentering predictors can be useful in multiple regression. By centering, we shift the zero-point of the predictor to a meaningful value, such as the mean value on that predictor. This helps in interpretation, because the intercept now gives us the mean value on the outcome for someone who has an average score on all predictors.\nAs previously explained, standardized regression coefficients drop the units of the predictor and outcome variable. They are calculated by transforming the predictors and outcome variable into z-scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and performing the (multiple) regression analysis on those z-scores. Because the units of the variables are dropped, standardized coefficients make the effects of predictors comparable across different studies or variables with different measurement units. They represent the change in the dependent variable in terms of standard deviations when the corresponding predictor increases by 1 standard deviation.",

    "section": "\n9.2 Causality",
    "text": "9.2 Causality\nA statistical association between variables does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. Instead, causality is either assumed on theoretical grounds, or established using the experimental method. In an experiment, researchers manipulate an independent variable and observe its effects on the dependent variable. However, in many social science studies, experiments are not feasible or ethical, so researchers rely on observational data. In these cases, establishing causal relationships relies on theory and careful statistical analysis.\nOne important concept in causal inference is the direction of effects. While statistical methods can identify associations between variables, determining the direction of causality is a causal assumption that cannot be estimated using statistics alone. The assumed direction of effects is often based on theory and prior knowledge of the subject matter. Researchers make informed assumptions about which variable is likely to have a causal effect on the other based on theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence.\nIn the process of analyzing causal relationships, it is essential to consider the presence of confounders, mediators, and colliders. Confounders are variables that are associated with both the independent and dependent variables and can create a spurious association or distort the true causal relationship. Identifying and controlling for confounders is crucial to ensure accurate causal inference.\nMediators, on the other hand, are variables that explain the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. They act as intermediate steps or process variables in the causal pathway. Understanding and analyzing mediation effects help us understand the underlying mechanisms through which the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\nColliders are variables that are caused by both the independent and dependent variables. Controlling for colliders can lead to spurious statistical relationships between unrelated variables. It is essential to be cautious when including variables in the analysis and consider the causal structure of the variables involved.\nOne important take-home message is that, in multiple regression, the distinction between confounders and colliders is crucial. Including confounders as control variables in multiple regression improves our inferences - but accidentally including a collider as control variable (severely) biases our inferences. You therefore have to carefully reason about each variable’s role in relation to the other variables in the model.",

So, R-square decreased with .021, indicating that Variety at Work uniquely explains 2.1% of the total variance in Pleasure at Work.\n\nLet’s do the same for the other two predictors; that is, check how much the R2 changes if you would remove the predictor from the model.\nWrite down the changes below.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWith Learning Possibilities removed, R square equals .211. R-square decreased with .058, which means that Learning Possibilities uniquely explains 5.8% of the total variance in Pleasure at Work. With Independence at Work removed, R square equals .260. R-square decreased with .009, which means that Independence at Work uniquely explains 0.9% of the total variance in Pleasure at Work.\n\nWhich predictor explained the least unique variance, controlling for the other two? \nVariety at work\nIndependence at work\nLearning possibilities",

We will first look at the Health variables (emotional pressure, physical demands, & mental pressure). We want to test whether Health has a direct effect on Need for recovery controlled for the social environment predictors.\nTo accomplish this, we have to do a hierarchical regression analysis, in which we compare two nested models: a small one, and a larger one.\nWrite down what these two models look like.\nHow many predictors does the smaller model contain? \nHow many predictors does the larger model contain? \n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nSmall model: \\(Recover_i = b0 + b1 * sccowork_i + b2 * scsuperv_i + e_i\\)\n\nLarge model: \\(Recover_i = b0 + b1 * sccowork_i + b2 * scsuperv_i + b3 *scmental_i + b4* scphys_i + b5* scemoti_i + e_i\\)\n\n\nThe small model has 2 predictors and the large model has 5 predictors.

Which error type could the researchers have made? \nType I error \nType II error\nType I or Type II error \n\n14.4.1 Examining Income\nIn the previous steps, we used the independent sample’s t-test to test for mean differences in public participation and found a significant result. Results suggested that males show higher levels of public participation. However, males and females may differ not only in gender, but also in other characteristics that explain differences in public participation. In particular, the researchers hypothesize that income differences may play a role as well. Research has shown that income is positively associated with public participation. So if males and females differ in income (on average), the gender differences in public participation may be partly due to income differences.\nIn other words, according to the researchers income may be a \npredictor\nmoderator\nconfounder\ncollider of the effect of gender.\nBefore we proceed, let’s first check whether the groups differ on income. Request the means for the variable income for both males and females separately.\nDo the males and females in the sample differ in average income?\nTake your existing syntax for gender differences in Participation, and change it to test for income differences instead:\nT-TEST GROUPS=Gender(0 1)\n  /MISSING=ANALYSIS\n  /VARIABLES=Income\n  /ES DISPLAY(TRUE)\n  /CRITERIA=CI(.95).\nIs there a difference in income? \nYes\nNo\nThe next step is to study gender differences controlled for income differences. This is not possible via the independent samples t-test interface, but it is possible when specifying our model using regression analyses. Regression analysis allows us to study gender differences controlling for other variables.\n\n14.4.2 Add continuous predictor\nBefore we proceed with the regression analysis including income (we will do this in the next assignment), we will first see what the regression model looks like if we would only use gender as the only predictor in the model.\nRun a regression analysis using Public Participation as the dependent variable, and gender as the independent variable (Analyze &gt; regression &gt; linear). Note that the variable gender is already dummy coded.\nInspect the table with Coefficients.\nWhat is the regression slope of gender? \nCompare the value to the mean difference from ; what do you see?\nRecall that the independent samples t-test is the exact same test as the t-test for the regression slope of a dummy variable.\nCompare the value of the t-statistic in the regression with the value of t-statistic in the independent samples t-test (you may ignore the minus signs). What do you see?\nThe regression coefficient of gender is 6.502. This is the same as the difference in means of Public Participation between males and females. The t-statistic of the regression coefficient is 4.942. The t-statistic in the independent samples t-test was -4.942. As we can ignore the minus sign (just make sure to check which group is higher than the other), we can conclude they are equal.\nWhat percentage of the total variance in public participation is explained by gender? \nRecall that the independent samples t-test and regression analysis with a dummy variable predictor are completely equivalent; SPSS just offers different interfaces to the same linear model.\nWe need to use the regression interface when we want to add other predictors (e.g., income) to see if the gender differences are confounded by other characteristics, and we can calculate the R2 value to evaluate the size of the effect of gender.\nNext, we want to know whether there are differences in public participation between men and women with the same income level.\nIn other words: let’s look at gender differences in public participation controlled for income.\nRun a regression analysis of public participation on income and gender (analyze -&gt; regression -&gt; linear). Consult the output and answer the following questions:\nGender and income jointly explain % of the variance in public participation.\nWhich of the following alternatives correctly report the F-statistic testing the significance of the R2? \nF(2,40)=26.845, p &lt; 0.001\nF(2,42)=26.845, p &lt; 0.001\nThe researchers conclude:\n“On average, women score 4.818 points higher on public participation than men.”\nIs this a valid conclusion? \nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation\n\nI hope you concluded that the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect.\nThey should have said:\n“On average, women score 4.818 points less on public participation than men of an equal income level”\nSo, if we take two groups of men and women with the same income (= “controlling for income”), then we expect a mean difference of 4.818 in public participation.\n\nIs there evidence of gender differences, while controlling for income differences when testing at \\(\\alpha = .01\\)? \nYes\nNo\nWrite down the complete regression equation, then check your answer below.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe regression equation is as follows:\n\\(\\text{Participation}_i = 5.762 + 3.475*\\text{Income}_i+ 4.818 * \\text{Gender}_i+e_i\\)\n\nSuppose we have a man with an income of 3.0 and a woman with an income of 2.0, what is the predicted difference in public participation? \n\n\nExplanation\n\nMan with an income of 3 has a predicted score of:\nPublic Participation′=5.762+3.475∗3+4.818 ∗1\nPublic Participation′=21.005\nWoman with an income of 2 has a predicted score of:\nPublic Participation′=5.762+3.475∗2+4.818 ∗ 0\nPublic Participation′=12.712\nDifference = 21,005 – 12,712\nDifference = 8.293\n\nWe previously computed the mean difference in public participation for men and women, which was 6.50.\nWhy is this previous mean difference not the same as the effect of gender that we find in this most recent regression analysis?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe mean difference as observed in the sample is the mean difference without controlling for income differences.\nHowever, as we have seen, men and women also differ in the average income, and income differences between males and females may also explain differences in public participation. In the regression analyses, we controlled for income differences, which means that we “filtered out” the effect of income (the correct way to say it: we partialed out income effects). After controlling for income the effect of gender is somewhat smaller. Hence, the difference in public participation in the sample means is partly due to income differences.\n\nOne researcher argues that there are gender differences in public participation, and gender differences in income, and that income additionally has an effect on public participation.\nIn this theoretical model, income is a \nConfounder\nCommon cause\nModerator\nMediator",

The intercept of the regression equation applies to the group coded 0 (the reference group), and the intercept of the group coded 1 is equal to the overall intercept plus the effect of the dummy variable. In formulas this is represented as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY &= a + bD \\text{, where D} \\in(0,1)\\\\\nY_{D=0} &= a + b*0 = a\\\\\nY_{D=1} &= a + b*1 = a + b\n\\end{align}\\]\nAn interaction implies that not only the intercept but also the regression slope differs between two groups.

Now, consider an interaction between two continuous predictors. In this scenario, each variable can theoretically take infinite possible values. Therefore, we can no longer think of this as a distinct regression line for each value of the moderator. Instead, we can imagine how an increase in the value of one interacting variable leads to an adjustment of the effect of the other interacting variable.\nTo grasp the concept of interaction effects with two continuous predictors, let’s dive into a concrete example. Imagine we’re investigating the relationship between outcome Y, and continuous predictors X1 and X2. We’ve determined the coefficients for our regression model:\n\\(Y = 12.50 + 1.50 \\cdot X_{1} - 0.20 \\cdot X_{2} + 0.07 \\cdot (X_{1} \\times X_{2})\\)\nLet’s do the same we did for understanding the regression equation with a binary moderator, and simplify it by plugging in a specific value for one of the interacting variables. Suppose we want to know the effect of X1 for someone who scores 0 on the continuous variable X2:\n\\(Y = 12.50 + 1.50 \\cdot X_{1} - 0.20 \\cdot 0 + 0.07 \\cdot (X_{1} \\times 0) = 12.50 + \\textbf{1.50} \\cdot X_{1}\\)\nThe effect for such a person is 1.50.

This is similar to the simple effects approach from before, except now it’s called simple slopes.\nInstead of computing the effect of one variable for all unique values of a binary moderator, we pick specific values of the continuous moderator - typically +/- 1SD - and calculate the effect of the other predictor at those specific values.\nBy centering the interacting predictors at their mean value +/- 1SD and re-computing the interaction term using those transformed predictors, we obtain simple slopes at different levels of the moderator.

    "text": "15.1 Interaction\nIn this assignment we work with the PublicParticipation.sav data. It contains (fictional) data on the following variables: income (higher scores, more income), public participation, education, age, and gender (0 = females; 1 = males). Public participation involves being member of school boards, municipal councillor, etc.\nIn this assignment we will see how we can model interaction between a continuous predictor and a dichotomous predictor.\nSuppose we are interested in relationship between age and public participation, and we want to know if the relationship is moderated by gender. An interaction model is conceptually represented as follows (these two diagrams are interchangeable):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling Interactions\nThe regression model for testing the interaction is:\n\\(Y' = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}D_{g} + b_{3}XD_{g}\\)\nwhere X = age, and D_g = gender (0 = women; 1 = men). Notice that women are our reference group.\nTo model interaction we need to create a new variable, which is the product of the dummy variable (gender in our case) and (age in our case).\nThis is best done via syntax, but to use the graphical interface proceed as follows:\nvia Transform &gt; compute variable\nGive the new variable a name (i.e., the target variable), say GenderTAge.\nThen specify the product at the right (see more information button). Click on Paste, select and run the code. Check in Data View whether the product term was added correctly.\nAlternatively, the syntax is:\nCOMPUTE GenderTAge = Gender * Age.\nEXECUTE.\nNow run the regression analysis that includes the interaction effect.\nImportant: Just like with dummies you must include all dummies that belong to the same variable in the model together, with an interaction term, you must always include its constituent variables as well. This is because the interaction term only modifies the effect of its constituent variables; the effect of those constituent variables must thus also be in the model.\nSo, if you add variable intXTZ into the model, you must also include X and Z.\nVia analyze &gt; regression &gt; linear; choose age, gender and GenderTAge as the independent variables, and public participation as the dependent variable.\nConsult the table Regression coefficients. Write down the general estimated model.\nFinish the following equation, then check your answer.\n\\(\\text{Public Participation' = .....}\\)\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\\(\\text{Public Participation}′ = 3.252 + 0.137*\\text{Age} + 12.439*\\text{Gender} − 0.116*\\text{Gender}*\\text{Age}\\)\n\nNow write down the estimated models down for women and men separately. Hint: fill in 0 and 1 in the general estimated model mentioned in the previous step, then simplify the formula.\nComplete the equations for women (W) and men (M):\n\\(\\text{PP}_W'=\\) \\(+\\) \\(*\\text{Age}\\)\n\\(\\text{PP}_M'=\\) \\(+\\) \\(*\\text{Age}\\)\nNow draw (on a piece of paper) a graph of the results. That is, put age on the x-axis, the predicted public participation on the y-axis, and draw separate regression lines for males and females.\nTrue or false\nIn the sample, age has a positive effect on public participation for women but a negative effect for men? \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThe researchers tested at the 5% level and concluded:\n“We have convincing evidence that the population effect of age on public participation is different for men and women.” \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThe estimated regression model was:\n\\(Y'= 3.252 + 0.137Age + 12.439D_g - 0.116(Age \\times D_g)\\)\nWhat would the regression equation look like if we would have used the men as the reference group? Use logic to answer this question, instead of re-running the analysis.\n\\(Y'=\\) \\(+\\) \\(*\\text{Age}+\\) \\(*D_g+\\) \\(*(\\text{Age} \\times D_g)\\)\n\nTo verify our answer to the previous question, we will recode the variable Gender such that males are scored 0 (= reference group) and females are scored 1.\nProceed as follows:\n\nvia Transform &gt; Recode into different variables\nSelect Gender.\nGive a name to the new output variable (say GenderFem), give a label (say: “Gender (ref=males)” click on change.\nSpecify old and new values: old value 0 becomes 1 and old value 1 becomes 0 (don’t forget to click on add in between).\nClick OK. Verify that SPSS added a new column with a dummy variable where males are the reference group.\nCompute the product variable for the interaction between age and gender but now use the dummy having males as reference group.\nRerun the regression analysis, but now using the new gender variable and interaction term. If you’re answer in the previous step is correct you should find the values back in the table Regression Coefficients.",

The outcome, Yi, is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution with an individual probability of success, pi. The logit of this success probability is modeled as a linear function of the predictors, allowing us to use the familiar linear regression model to predict the logit of pi.\nUnderstanding the distinction between probability, odds, and the logit is crucial in logistic regression. Probability is defined as the long-run proportion of outcomes of a random experiment in which a particular outcome is observed. Odds describe the ratio of the probability of an event occurring relative to the probability of it not occurring.

For continuous predictors, the odds ratio is a multiplyer by which the odds increase when the predictor increases by one unit.\nTo calculate the odds ratio for a logistic regression coefficient (b), we use the formula OR = e^(b). A value greater than 1 indicates that the predictor is associated with higher odds of the outcome, while a value less than 1 indicates lower odds of the outcome. For example, if the odds ratio for the test score coefficient (b = 2.12) is 8.35, it means that for each unit increase in the test score, the odds of the outcome are multiplied by 8.35.",

This way, you will learn how to work with probability, odds, and logits.\nThe given probability is P = 0.36.\nWhat are the corresponding odds? \nPlease find the formula’s below:\n\n\nGoal\nFunction\n\n\n\nProbability -&gt; Odds\n\\(odds = P/(1-P)\\)\n\n\nOdds -&gt; Probability\n\\(P = odds/(1+Odds)\\)\n\n\nOdds -&gt; Logit\n\\(logit = \\ln(odds)\\)\n\n\nLogit -&gt; Odds\n\\(odds = e^{logit}\\)\n\n\n\nAgain, the given probability is P = 0.36.\nWhat is the corresponding logit? \nThe given logit is – 2.7.\nWhat are the corresponding odds? \nAgain, the given logit is – 2.7. \nDiscuss with your group mates when and why we should carry out logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nExplanation\n\nWe carry out logistic regression analysis when we want to carry out regression analysis and we have a dichotomous outcome variable (i.e., a dependent variable with two answer categories). In that case we cannot use linear regression because several of the assumptions of linear regression are violated.\n\nIn a study concerning the smoking behavior amongst adolescents, a logistic regression analysis is conducted to check the effect of the image of smoking (Image) on smoking behavior (Smoking).\nImage: to what degree the young adult thinks smoking is perceived as “cool”. The variable image is measured on a scale from 10 to 30, in which higher scores indicate that smoking is perceived as cooler.\nSmoking: whether or not the adolescent smokes.\n\n0 = the adolescent is a non-smoker\n1 = the adolescent is a smoker\n\nBelow you can find part of the output the researchers retrieved.\n\nFirst, write down the estimated regression model.\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\\(Logit(Smoking = 1) = -5.65 + 0.28*Image\\)\n\nWhat is the probability that an adolescent with a score of 15 on image smokes? \nTake a look at the regression coefficient.\n\nImagine that one’s score on Image will increase from 15 to 16.\nTo what degree will the logit and odds change?\nAnd what can you conclude about the increase in probability?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe logit increases with 0.284. So −1.387+0.284=−1.103\nThe odds increase with a factor 1.328. So, the odds become 0.25×1.328=0.332\nBy just looking at the output, it is unclear what exactly will happen with the probability. We DO know that the probability will increase because the logits and the odds increase.\nIf we would calculate the probability by hand, we would see that the probability increases with 0.05.\n\nAs you can see, the logit follows a linear function, the odds follow an exponential function, and probability follows a logistic function (perhaps less clear from the example but see the graphs below for an illustration). It is nice to work with a linear model (i.e., work with the logits), but from an interpretation point of view odds and probabilities are nicer to work with.",

This is an unusual step, because dichotomizing variables loses information! Still, for the purpose of the present exercise, we will do so. We will create the new dependent variable Passed (0 = fail, 1 = pass), where a 5.5 or higher counts as a pass. Use the following steps:\nNavigate to Transform → Recode into different variables. Select GradeStats as input variable and use Passed as the name for the new recoded variable. Do not forget to click on CHANGE. Click on Old and new values and specify the recoding in such a way that all grades of 5.5 or higher will get the new value 1 and all grades lower than 5.5 (i.e., all other grades) the value 0.

A hiking guide has displayed five different types of behavior towards different groups of hikers. The treatment that each person received from the guide is recorded in the variable behavior.\nThe dependent variable of this experiment is feeling. Higher scores on this variable indicate a more positive attitude of a participant towards the guide. In this assignment, we will use ANOVA to determine whether the mean score on the dependent variable differs between the five experimental conditions.\nThe data file contains a third variable named weather which can be either good or bad. For now, we will only look at the results obtained during good weather. Hence, we will use “Select cases” to select only those participants with a value of 1 on the weather variable.\nAdditionally, the data contains a variable named balanced which distinguishes between data resulting from a balanced experiment (with equal sample sizes in all groups), and from an unbalanced experiment (with unequal group sizes).

    "text": "15.5 Comparing Groups of Means\nExtending the methods above, it is also possible to compare groups of means. For example, we might wonder whether negative behaviors (rushing and insulting) differ significantly from positive behaviors (stories, jokes, and singing).\nThis approach builds upon the logic of effects coding, where the weights for the reference category were based on the relative sample size of the reference category. This time, however, the weights for the category to be compared to the reference category are also based on a sample size.\nWe are going to perform several steps, as explained in the lecture.\n\n15.5.1 Step 1: Plan Contrasts\nKeep in mind these rules:\n\nThe possible values of each indicator variable must sum to 0.\nEach group must be uniquely identified by a particular combination of the contrast variables.\n\nAssume for a moment that we have equal group sizes and want to compare groups 1 and 2 to groups 3, 4, and 5.\nAppropriate contrasts would then be (I’m using the letter C to indicate that these are not dummies or effect indicators):\n\n\nbehavior\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\n\n\n\nrushing\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\ninsulting\n1\n-1\n0\n0\n\n\ntelling stories\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nmaking jokes\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n-1\n1\n\n\nsinging\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n-1\n-1\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nEach column sums to 0\nEvery level of behavior is uniquely identified by some combination of contrasts\n\nIn this case, we only care about C1; we created C2, C3 and C4 to ensure that every level of behavior is uniquely identified. But what do C2-C4 test?\nC2 compares the two negative behaviors; C3 compares stories against jokes and singing. C4 compares jokes and singing.\n\n15.5.2 Step 2: Account for Group Size\nNow, we have to account for the relative sample sizes of these groups to ensure that we can interpret the coefficients as the difference between the means of those combinations of groups.\nUse the descriptive statistics you previously obtained to weight the contrasts from step 1.\nE.g., contrast C3 below is already completed. Which other contrasts do you still need to change? \nC1\nC1, C2, C4\nnone\nC2 and C4\n\n\nbehavior\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\n\n\n\nrushing\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\ninsulting\n1\n-1\n0\n0\n\n\ntelling stories\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nmaking jokes\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n-13/(11+13)\n1\n\n\nsinging\n-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n0\n-11/(11+13)\n-1\n\n\n\n15.5.3 Step 3: Do Matrix Algebra\nEnter the complete matrix into a spreadsheet program. Add one column before the contrasts with an intercept for each group, equal to \\(1/k\\).\nWhat’s the value of this intercept for this study? \n\nClick an Empty cell\nPaste =MINVERSE(TRANSPOSE(\n\nSelect your contrast matrix\nFinish the formula by typing closing brackets ))\n\n\nThese are the values you will use for your indicators!\nNow, write syntax to create the contrasts using the values you calculated in a spreadsheet. Give these contrasts informative names to help remind yourself of their interpretation. Here is one example; complete the rest yourself:\nRECODE behavior (1=.6) (2=.6) (3=-.4) (4=-.4) (5= -.4) INTO posVneg.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nRECODE behavior (1=.6) (2=.6) (3=-.4) (4=-.4) (5= -.4) INTO posVneg.\nRECODE behavior (1=.5) (2=-.5) (3=0) (4=0) (5= 0) INTO rushVinsult.\nRECODE behavior (1=-.01) (2=-.01) (3=.67) (4=-.33) (5= -.33) INTO storyVjokesing.\nRECODE behavior (1=.02) (2=.02) (3=.02) (4=.48) (5= -.53) INTO ? .\nEXECUTE.\n\nWhat does the final contrast encode? \npositive versus negative\nall levels\njoke versus singing\nstory vs singing",

You have learned that the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) indicates the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion (Type I error). However, these probabilities add up for multiple tests! So when you perform many tests, you can be in a situation where you have a very high probability of comitting at least one Type I error.\nWe call the total probability of committing at least one Type I error across multiple tests in the same study the “family-wise” or experiment-wise Type I error. You compute it as:\n\\(P(1+ Type I error) = 1 − (1 − \\alpha)^{\\text{number of tests}}\\)\nSo if we perform 3 comparisons, the probability of committing at least one Type I error is: \nAnd if we perform 10 tests? \nIf this makes you uncomfortable - you’re not alone! People often seek to maintain a low risk of drawing any false-positive conclusions, and we can do so simply by lowering \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n15.7.1 Bonferroni correction\nBonferroni proposed a simple correction of \\(\\alpha = \\alpha_{EW}/m\\), where \\(\\alpha_{EW}\\) is the desired experiment-wise Type I error rate (e.g., .05), and \\(m\\) is the number of tests.\nWhat alpha level would you use per test if you want to achieve an experiment-wise alpha of .05 and conduct 7 tests? \nThe Bonferroni correction is quite conservative; in other words - although Bonferroni helps you avoid false-positive conclusions, it becomes much harder to detect true effects.",

To do so, we want to specify a “full factorial” model. This simply means that we want to know if there is an interaction effect between the two categorical variables. The way to include an interaction effect is to multiply the predictor.

    "text": "17.3 ANOVA interface\nSPSS also has a dedicated “ANOVA interface”. It specifies exactly the same model as we have been investigating, but its output is more focused on information that is typically requested when estimating a model with only categorical predictors and (optionally) interactions between them.\nWe will now use the ANOVA interface and pay special attention to output it gives us that is not directly available via the Regression interface.\nYou can either use the graphical user interface, or copy-paste this syntax. Either way, pay particular attention to the following:\n\nUnder Options, ask for Homogeneity tests: /PRINT=HOMOGENEITY\n\nUnder Options, ask for Estimates of effect size: /PRINT=ETASQ\n\nUnder Options, ask for Parameter Estimates: /PRINT=PARAMETER\n\nUnder EM Means (expected marginal means), ask for the means for the interaction, and compare Main effects: /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)\n\n\nUNIANOVA Tip BY Behavior Gender\n  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)\n  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE\n  /PLOT=PROFILE(Behavior*Gender)\n  /PRINT=ETASQ HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE PARAMETER\n  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Gender) ADJ(LSD)\n  /DESIGN=Behavior Gender Behavior*Gender.\nCopy and run this syntax.\nNote that the table labelled Parameter Estimates is identical to the Coefficients table from the previous regression analysis.\nAlso note that, for example, the F-value for the explained variance for the interaction between Gender an Behavior is identical to the F-value for the \\(\\Delta R^2\\) test you performed in the previous hierarchical regression analysis.\n\n17.3.1 Homoscedasticity\nRegression models have an assumption of homoscedasticity. If all predictors are categorical, that means that we assume equal variances in all groups.\nThe ANOVA output offers us a Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance. Find it, and answer the following question:\nTrue or false: There is reason to doubt the assumption of homogeneity. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nWhat is the value of the appropriate test statistic? \nTrue or false: As a rule, the assumption of homogeneity is more likely to be violated in a factorial ANOVA with an unbalanced design (as compared to a balanced design). \nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n17.3.2 Effect size\nWe can also calculate effect sizes \\(\\eta^2\\) or partial \\(\\eta^2\\), for the two factors and the interaction effect separately.\nRecall that \\(\\eta^2\\) is just the explained variance, \\(R^2\\). In other words: What proportion of the total sum of squares is explained by the factor of interest?\nWe obtain \\(\\eta^2\\) for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, \\(SS_A\\), by the \\(SST\\), which is labeled “Corrected total” in the ANOVA output: \\(\\eta^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SST}\\)\nWhat is \\(\\eta^2\\) for the interaction effect? \nGo back to your previous nested model test, where you determined whether adding the interaction terms led to a significant improvement in explained variance, \\(\\Delta R^2\\). Verify that this number is identical to the \\(\\eta^2\\) for the interaction! They are the same thing.\nAnother measure of effect size is the partial \\(\\eta^2\\). It tells us what proportion of the variance not explained by other factors is explained by the factor of interest.\nWe obtain \\(\\eta_p^2\\) for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, \\(SS_A\\), by \\(SS_A\\) plus the residual sum of squares \\(SSE\\): \\(\\eta_p^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SS_A+SSE}\\).\nNote that SPSS allows us to request partial \\(\\eta^2\\). We did so by including the line /PRINT=ETASQ in our syntax.\nWhat is the value of partial \\(\\eta^2\\) for the factor Behavior? \n\n17.3.3 Pairwise comparisons\nAnother unique feature of the ANOVA interface is that it gives us all pairwise comparisons when we ask for them using the code /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)\nNote that this line asks for comparisons of the three levels of behavior for each gender separately. You can also ask for comparisons of the two levels of gender for each behavior separately by specifying COMPARE(Gender) instead.\nInspect the table Pairwise Comparisons. The three experimental conditions are compared in a pairwise manner, split over the factor Gender.\nFor which pair of groups do the means differ significantly from one another (at the 5% level)? \nWaitress: Neutral-Smiley\nWaiter: Neutral-Small talk\nWaiter: Neutral-Smiley\nWaiter: Small talk-Smiley\nLook at the note under the table. True or false: the p-values in this table are adjusted for multiple comparisons. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nWhy do we need to apply a correction like the Bonferroni correction?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhen doing multiple tests on one sample, like doing these pairwise comparisons, the level of risk of a Type I error increases. To correct for this, we should use an adjusted alpha-level, such as the Bonferroni correction.\nAlthough it is possible to ask for SPSS to adjust the p-values in the table, I have expressly not instructed you to do so. The reason for this is that, strictly speaking, Bonferroni is an adjustment of the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) - not of the p-values. Moreover, sometimes you conduct many more tests in a study aside from the pairwise comparisons performed here. In that case, you might want to include those in your Bonferroni correction too, and SPSS does not know about their existence when it applies a Bonferroni correction to the p-values.\nIn other words: It is better to set the alpha level yourself, and apply it consistently across all tests in a study.\n\n\n17.3.4 Simple Effects test\nThe significant interaction effect tells us that the effect of behavior differs by gender, or conversely, that gender differences vary across the three behavoirs.\nSimple effects analysis allows us to test the significance of these marginal effects.\nSimply put: They give us an overall test of the mean differences across levels of one factor, within each level of a different factor.\nConsult the table Univariate Tests (still for the contrast /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)). This table displays the results of the simple effects tests.\nDoes the Behavior of waiters have an influence on the amount of tip money people give?\nWhat is the appropriate p-value? \nReport the simple effect test for waiters and interpret the finding, then check your answer.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThere is no significant difference among the three behaviors within waiters. Hence, for waiters we don’t have evidence that the behavior has an effect on average tips received, F(2,52) = 0.591, p = .557.\n\nAgain, consult the table Univariate Tests. This table gives the results of the simple effects tests.\nWhat p-value do we see here? \nTrue or false: the type of behavior of waitresses has an influence on the tip people give. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nDoes it make sense to adjust your behavior as a waiter/waitress if you want to increase your tip?\n\nFor waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waiters it does not.For both waiters and waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received.For waiters behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waitresses it does not.For both waiters and waitresses behavior does not affect amount of tip money received.\n\nReport your results, then check the answer.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe do see a significant effect of behavior on average tip money for waitresses, F(2,52) = 46.385, p &lt; .001. Hence, we have convincing evidence that the type of behavior by waitresses affects the average amount of tips. Results suggest that in order to have high tips, waitresses best can make small talk.",

Examples of common covariates include age, gender, education level, or any other variables that might influence the dependent variable.\nIn terms of causality, it’s crucial to consider the relationships between covariates, predictors, and the outcome variable. Control variables should ideally be confounders – variables that influence both the predictor of interest and the outcome. It’s essential to avoid controlling for colliders, which are variables caused by both the predictor and the outcome. A thorough understanding of causal relationships is crucial for proper interpretation.\nOne reason why researchers use control variables in ANCOVA is because they reduce the residual variance in the outcome variable, which in turn increases the power to detect the effect of the predictor of interest. Another reason to use covariates is when the goal is making causal inferences, especially in quasi-experimental designs. The proper selection of covariates that enable causal inference requires careful consideration and is beyond the scope of this course.",

An example of a good control is a confounder: a variable that causes both the predictor and the outcome. These need to be controlled to avoid spurious relationships. An example of a neutral control is a covariate that is unrelated to the predictor but can reduce error variance in the outcome, thereby increasing statistical power. Bad controls, on the other hand, can introduce biases, such as collider bias (controlling for an outcome of predictor and outcome), case control bias (controlling for an outcome of the outcome), or overcontrol bias (controlling for a mediator of the effect of the focal predictor on the outcome).\nOne crucial insight is that in randomized controlled experiments, the random assignment of participants to different groups breaks the relationship between confounders and the treatment variable. This makes control variables related to the confounders unnecessary. Controlling for them could even introduce bias into the analysis.",

For their research they performed a quasi-experiment. They selected three schools and asked girls from eight grade to do a math test. However, the teacher in School A says that boys do particularly well on the test (i.e., negative stereotyping for girls). In School B the teachers says that girls do particularly well on the test (i.e., positive stereotyping for girls). In the third school, the teacher gives gender-neutral information (control group).\nAfterwards the researchers compare the average math grades across the three groups. Because the schools may also differ in the student population, researchers also measured scholastic aptitude and use that as a covariate in the analysis.\nOpen the dataset stereotyping.sav.\nIn your own words, explain what a covariate is and give two examples of covariates that should/can be included in neuro-psychological research.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCovariates are “nuissance” variables that we are not directly interested in, but that allow us to better estimate the effect of another variable of interest.\nThis is related to causal inference.\nWe must thus justify our covariates by reference to their putative causal role with relation to our predictor and outcome.\nA covariate that causes both our predictor and our outcome is a confounder, and should be controlled for.

    "text": "18.3 ANCOVA\nThe next step is to add scholastic aptitude as a covariate in our analysis.\nIn the lecture, we considered two situations in which ANCOVA is used; one in which the covariate was not related to the grouping variable, and one in which the covariate is associated.\nWhich situation do we have in this study? To answer the question, you need to ask for some additional statistics in SPSS.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe can check if the covariate is associated with the experimental factor by inspecting the means of the experimental groups on the covariate, or by running a one-way ANOVA.\nThe covariate is associated with the grouping variable, and thus mean differences in math between the three groups may be confounded by mean differences in scholastic aptitude between the three groups.\n\n\n18.3.1 Assumption or not?\nSome texts state that ANCOVA has an additional assumption, beyond those of multiple regression. This “extra assumption” is the assumption of “homogeneity in regression slopes”.\nThe assumption of homogeneity in regression slopes states that the within-group effect of the covariate is the same across groups. That is, the covariate does not interact with the grouping variable.\nFor example, in this assignment, the assumption would imply that the effect of scholastic aptitude is independent of the experimental condition.\nBut: ANCOVA is just a special name for multiple regression with a categorical predictor of interest and control variables that we’re not interested in (“nuissance variables”). If ANCOVA is multiple regression, then how can it have differen assumptions than multiple regression?\nThe answer is that ANCOVA does not have different assumptions, but if we were to allow for interaction between the factor and covariate, we would simply no longer call the resulting model an ANCOVA.\nSo instead of saying “ANCOVA has an assumption of homogeneity in regression slopes”, we could say: “it is conventional to call a model ANCOVA if it contains a factor and some control variables, but no interaction”. Of course we can add interaction terms in such a model - but then we just call it multiple regression with an interaction, not ANCOVA.\nOmitting an interaction between the factor and the covariate means that we force the within-group effect of the covariate to be the same across levels of the factor. In this study, that means that we do not allow the effect of scholastic aptitude to depend on the experimental condition.\nBefore we carry out the actual ANCOVA, we can check whether this model is correctly specified, or whether we are missing a significant interaction. We can check whether there is a significant interaction effect using the following syntax:\n    UNIANOVA SA BY STEREO WITH MATH\n      /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)\n      /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE\n      /PRINT=DESCRIPTIVE PARAMETER HOMOGENEITY\n      /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)\n      /DESIGN=STEREO MATH MATH*STEREO.\nCopy and run the syntax. Go to the table “Tests of Between-Subjects Effects”. Take a look at the row STEREO*MATH.\nTrue or false: There is a significant interaction effect. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nIf there is a significant interaction effect, what do we do?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nRemember we can check for a significant interaction effect for two reasons:\n\nOur hypothesis is about the interaction effect\nAs an assumption check for correct model specification (i.e., we’re interested in main effects, but we want to make sure that we’re not ignoring an interaction when we do). This is similar to checking for linearity.\n\nIn the first case, we should not be conducting ANCOVA at all; we should start with multiple regression with interaction, because the interaction effect is our effect of interest.\nIn the second case, we can do two things: We can change our analysis based on the results of the “assumption check” - but such data-dependent decisions increase the risk of overfitting and Type I errors. Alternatively, we can just report the results of our planned ANCOVA analysis, but mention in the discussion that we observed a significant interaction, which means that the model may have been misspecified. We can also report results from both models, and see if/how the conclusions change if we allow for interaction (this is called a sensitivity analysis).\n\n\n18.3.2 Back to ANCOVA\nLet’s run an ANCOVA, proceed as follows:\n\nNavigate to Analyze &gt; General linear model ? Univariate\nSelect MATH as the dependent variable, STEREO as fixed factor, and SA as the covariate.\nAlso, via OPTIONS ask for the Parameter estimates. Paste and run the syntax.\n\nConsider the Tests of Between Subjects Effects table (henceforth referred to as the “ANCOVA table”) and the FF-test for the grouping factor (STEREO).\nWhat’s the p-value for the overall test of model fit? \nWhat conclusions can be drawn from the F-test?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe F-test is a test of the effect of Stereotyping on Math performance controlled for Scholastic aptitude. Conceptually, it tests whether differences in the adjusted means in Math performance are significant. Adjusted means are the means we would expect if the group had an average level of Scholastic aptitude.\nIn other words, it tests the differences in the hypothetical situation we would have had three groups that had exactly the same level of Scholastic aptitude.\nThe F-test is not significant, F(2,26) = 2.333, p = .117, which means that, controlled for Scholastic aptitude, we don’t have convincing evidence that Stereotyping had an effect on Match performance.\n\nCompare the results ANOVA and ANCOVA. What important difference do we see and how would you explain those?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe ANOVA suggested a significant effect, whereas once controlled for Scholastic aptitude (ANCOVA) the effect was no longer significant.\nThus, the mean differences between the experimental groups we saw before were indeed confounded with differences in Scholastic aptitude!\n\nConsult the table parameter estimates.\nWhat is the regression slope for scholastic aptitude? \nExplain the meaning of estimated parameter for scholastic aptitude.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe parameter estimate for Scholastic aptitude is 0.470. The effect is significant when using \\(\\alpha\\) = .05.\nIt is the pooled within-group regression effect of Scholastic aptitude on Math performance, controlled for Stereotyping.\nThus, if Scholastic aptitude increases by one unit, the predicted Math score increases by .470 units, while controlling for Stereotyping.\n\nBased on the Parameters Estimates and the group-specific means, compute the adjusted group means (for each of the groups!) on MATH for an average scholastic aptitude.\nWhat is the adjusted group mean for the group that received the Negative Stereotype manipulation? \n\\(\\bar{Y}_k^{adj} = \\bar{Y}_k -b_w(\\bar{X}_k- \\bar{X})\\)\nTo use the formula, you need to know the group means on MATH (you computed them before), you have to know the group means and overall mean SA (you can compute them via means), and the regression effect which is given in the table with parameter estimates.\nCheck your adjusted means against this answer model:\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nRerun the ANCOVA. Now via OPTIONS also ask for the estimated means. You do so by selecting stereo in the list of Display Means for (at the top of the menu). Look in the table Estimated Marginal Means and verify your answer to the previous question.\nWrite down in your own words – and as precise as possible – the meaning of adjusted means.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe estimated marginal means (i.e., the adjusted means) are the group means if all groups would’ve had an average of 6.20 on the covariate.\n\nFinally, we want to look at several effect size estimates.\nHow much of the variance in Math do SA and STEREO explain? \nControlled for SA, how much of the remaining variance in Math does STEREO explain? Use the formula mentioned in the lecture slides to calculate the partial \\(\\eta^2\\): \nVerify your answer by running the ANCOVA again. Now, in options, select the box Estimates if effect size.\nTrue or false: SPSS reports the same partial η2. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nCould you summarize your findings of the ANCOVA in a few brief sentences?\nMention the significance tests, (un)adjusted means and the effect size estimates.",

However, learning effects, memory effects, and change over time need to be considered when determining the appropriate interval between test administrations.\n\n17.2.2 Internal Consistency\nInternal consistency measures the association among items within a test. It can be estimated using methods such as split halves or Cronbach’s alpha. Split halves involve dividing the test into two halves and correlating the scores between them. Cronbach’s alpha is a measure of internal consistency that indicates how closely related items are to each other within a scale. It is affected by the number of items, their average covariance, and their average variance. Note that this means you can artificially inflate Cronbach’s alpha by using very similar items, or using very many items.\nWhen diagnosing the internal consisteny of a scale, we can compute item-total correlations to examine the correlation between individual items and the total scale score (minus that item). Low item-total correlations may indicate problematic items, and Cronbach’s alpha can be recalculated with items removed to assess their impact on reliability.",

    "text": "17.3 Validity\nValidity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. There are several types of validity, including face validity (whether the items appear relevant to the construct), content validity (whether the instrument adequately covers all aspects of the construct), and criterion validity (whether the instrument is associated with relevant outcomes or indicators of the construct).\n\n17.3.1 Face Validity\nFace validity assesses whether items in an instrument are clearly related to the construct of interest. It considers the clarity, readability, and unambiguity of wording and answer options. Face validity is subjective and relies on a first-glance assessment of whether the items seem relevant to the construct being measured.\n\n17.3.2 Content Validity\nContent validity is usually determined by involving experts in the field, and having them define the construct’s scope, generating items for subdomains of the construct, and rating the relevance of items. An instrument has content validity if it adequately covers all aspects of the construct. Content validity is essential for ensuring that the instrument comprehensively captures the intended construct.\n\n17.3.3 Criterion Validity\nCriterion validity assesses whether an instrument is associated with outcomes or indicators of the construct it is designed to measure. This can involve correlations between the instrument and external measures (e.g., other validated scales) or predictions of behavior related to the construct. Criterion validity provides evidence that the instrument measures what it is intended to measure.\nIn sum, effective measurement instruments in the social sciences must have both high reliability and high validity. Reliability ensures that the instrument consistently measures the same construct with low measurement error, and validity ensures that the instrument accurately measures the intended construct (not something else). By considering these principles, researchers can enhance the quality and meaningfulness of their questionnaire-based measurements.",

The data file contains data on Machiavellianism and some other variables.\nThe included Machiavellianism scale consists of the following 20 items. These items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale ranging from “Disagree” to “Agree”.\nQ1. Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so.\nQ2. The best way to handle people is to tell them what they want to hear.\nQ3. One should take action only when sure it is morally right.\nQ4. Most people are basically good and kind.\nQ5. It is safest to assume that all people have a vicious streak, and it will come out when they are given a chance.\nQ6. Honesty is the best policy in all cases.\nQ7. There is no excuse for lying to someone else.\nQ8. Generally speaking, people won’t work hard unless they’re forced to do so.\nQ9. All in all, it is better to be humble and honest than to be important and dishonest.\nQ10. When you ask someone to do something for you, it is best to give the real reasons for wanting it rather than giving reasons which carry more weight.\nQ11. Most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives.\nQ12. Anyone who completely trusts anyone else is asking for trouble.\nQ13. The biggest difference between most criminals and other people is that the criminals are stupid enough to get caught.\nQ14. Most people are brave.\nQ15. It is wise to flatter important people.\nQ16.

It is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there.\nQ19. People suffering from incurable diseases should have the choice of being put painlessly to death.\nQ20. Most people forget more easily the death of their parents than the loss of their property.\nItems can be indicative or contra-indicative of a certain trait.\nWhich items are contra-indicative to the trait Machiavellianism?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn this assignment, the following questions are contra-indicative: Q3, Q4, Q6, Q7, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q14, Q16, and Q17.\nIf an item is contra indicative, low scores on these items indicate a lot of Machiavellianist traits, whereas high scores indicate not so much of an endorsement of Machiavellianist traits in one’s personality.\n\nWe need to recode contraindicative items before we carry out reliability analysis.\nHowever, just to see what happens, let’s first carry out a reliability analysis with all original (i.e. not recoded) variables.\nTake the following steps:\nAnalyze –&gt; Scale –&gt; Reliability Analysis\nSelect the 20 items (Q1A - Q20A)\nClick on Statistics\nUnder Descriptives, select Items, Scale, and Scale if item deleted\nUnder Inter-Item, select Correlations\nPaste and run the syntax\nWhat is the estimated reliability? \nTrue or false: This scale can be considered reliable. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nThis low reliability might be a result of the fact that we have not recoded our contra-indicative items yet. We can also see this in the inter-item correlation table; many of the items are negatively correlated! Let’s rectify this.\nWe have to recode all contraindicative items. Use syntax to do so, and check your answer below.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCOMPUTE Q3r = 6-Q3A.\nEXECUTE.\n\nFor the second person in the dataset, the original score on Q4A was  and the score on the recoded variable Q4r was .\nBased on this comparison, do you think you successfully recoded the variable?\nWe will now run the reliability analysis including the recoded items. Chnge your syntax, or re-run the analysis via the visual interface.\nWhat is the value of Cronbach’s Alpha? \nThis Cronbach’s Alpha is \nPoor\nGood\nQuestionable\nAdequate\nCheck the corrected item total correlations.\nWhich of these items has the smallest association with other items in the scale? (Type its name) \nExplain why you think it makes sense (or not) that this item is correlated the least with the rest of the scale.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThis item-total correlation of Q19 is .255.\nItem Q19 reads: “People suffering from incurable diseases should have the choice of being put painlessly to death”.\nOne could argue that a high score on this item should relate to a low score on the scale for agreeing with this item nowadays might actually show empathy with those suffering.\n\nInspect Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted. If you had to remove one item based on this Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted, which item would it be? (Type its original name) \n\n\nExplanation\n\nBased on the Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted, we would delete the item that would result in the greatest increase in Cronbach’s Alpha if it would be deleted.\nWe find the highest Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted for the item Q17r (.889).\nTherefore, based on the Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted, we would delete item Q17r.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, would you remove any items from the Machiavellianism scale?\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTaking the statistical output into consideration, we might want to consider removing item Q17r or item Q19.\nWe do so for two reasons:\n\nThey both correlate less than .3 with the other items on the scale, and\nhave a Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted higher than .887 (the current Cronbach’s Alpha of the scale).\n\nPlease note that we should always take into consideration theoretical reasons as well when deciding to delete an item from a scale. In this assignment, however, we base our conclusions on statistical reasons only.\nYou might want to consider removing item Q17 or Q19. They both correlate less than .3 with the rest of the scale, and have an Alpha if item removed higher than .887.\n\nWe always remove items one by one. We start with the worst item. After removing a bad item from a scale, the item-statistics will change a little. It might be that the item-statistics improve, and that there is no need to remove the second item.\nHowever, since the differences are not that big and the scale reliability is pretty high, we will keep both items in our scale for the remainder of this assignment.\nOnce we finished reliability analysis, we can use the scale in other analyses.\nIn order to do that, we need to arrive at a total scale score. So, we need one score for each person in the dataset that tells what their score is on the personality trait Machiavellianism.\nThere are several methods of obtaining such a total score, but one straightforward and easy way is to calculate the sum score.\nNavigate to Transform -&gt; Compute Variable.\nGive a new name to the sum score in the box Target Variable, such as Mach.\nIn the box Numeric Expression, enter all variables and add together (i.e., Q1A + Q2A + Q3r …. + Q20A). Ensure that you use the recoded variables for the contra-indicative items!\nPaste and run the syntax.\nWe will now use our newly developed scale in a regression analysis! In this analysis we will try to explain Machiavellianism based on the variables Gender (0=men; 1=women), Age and Voted (0=Voted in past election, 1= Not voted in past election).\nNavigate to Analyze –&gt; Regression –&gt; Linear\nEnter the sumscore Mach as dependent variable\nEnter Gender, Age, and Voted as independent variables\nPaste and run the syntax\nInspect the Model Summary table. How much of the variance in Machiavellianism do the variables Gender, Age and Voted explain? \nTrue or false: Gender, Age and Voting together explain a significant amount of variance in the variable Machiavellianism. \nTRUE\nFALSE\nInspect the table Coefficients and take a look at the partial effects. Which of the variables does not have a significant partial effect on Machiavellianism? \nGender\nAge\nVoting\nControlled for Age and Voting, which group (men or women) scores higher on the Machiavellianism scale? \nMen\nWomen\n\n\nExplanation\n\nGiven that in the variable Gender men are coded as 0 and women are coded as 1, and that the regressions coefficient for Gender is negative (-7.440), we should conclude that men score higher on Machiavellianism than women, controlled for Age and Voting.\n\nFinish the following sentence.\nControlled for Gender and Voting, if we would increase one year in age, the predicted score on the Machiavellianism scale would \nIncrease with 0.294 units.\nDecrease with 0.294 units.\nIncrease with 0.243 units.\nDecrease with 0.243 units.",

The primary use of PCA is dimension reduction by retaining only components that explain a significant amount of variance, thus providing a lower-dimensional representation of the data.\nWe can understand PCA in different ways. Firstly, as rotation of the data. PCA rotates the data so that the first component best reproduces the correlation matrix, and each subsequent component improves the reproduction. Secondly, we can understand PCA as a way to summarize k items using fewer than k components, without significant information loss (lossy compression of data).\nSelecting the Number of Components:\nVarious strategies exist to determine the number of components to retain, including Kaiser’s criterion (Eigenvalue &gt; 1), Cattell’s scree plot (inflection point), and Horn’s Parallel Analysis (comparison with random data’s Eigenvalues).

    "section": "\n18.6 Exploratory Factor Analysis",
    "text": "18.6 Exploratory Factor Analysis\nEFA is a model-based approach that assumes the existence of latent variables that cause item responses. It is suitable when you expect clusters of items to be correlated (multicollinear) and seeks to explain correlations between items. EFA assumes that unexplained variance in the items can be attributed to measurement error. This aligns with test theory, where it is assumed that observed items measure latent constructs with error. EFA is particularly suitable when there is a theoretical basis for assuming the existence of latent variables, such as when developing a new questionnaire that has not been validated yet. However, if a theoretical model already exists, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) may be more appropriate.\nTo conduct EFA, we estimate the unknown factor loadings. Two common estimation methods are Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML). PAF is a default method in SPSS and is based on an iterative procedure involving matrix algebra. It provides a solution even when the model is complex or the data are non-normal. On the other hand, ML is the same estimator used for CFA and works well when the data are multivariate normal. However, ML may not perform well when the model is overly complex (which is not necessarily a bad thing). ML estimation also allows for a test of model fit, which is useful for evaluating the appropriateness of the chosen model.\nFactor loadings represent the correlations between each item and the extracted factors. They indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between the observed item and the underlying factor. Factor loadings range from -1 to +1, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger relationship. In our example, we can see the factor loadings in a factor matrix, where each row corresponds to an item and each column corresponds to a factor. The factor loadings help us identify which items load more strongly on specific factors.\nWe can compute Eigenvalues in EFA just as in PCA by taking the column sums of the squared loadings and indicate the amount of variance explained by each factor. Eigenvalues are always smaller than the initial eigenvalues obtained in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) because some variance is now attributed to error variance. Consequently, the sum of the Eigenvalues is also less than the number of indicators, and some Eigenvalues may even be negative.\nSimilarly, communalities in EFA are always &lt; 1 because EFA assumes the existence of error variance.\n\n18.6.1 Selecting the Number of Factors\nDetermining the appropriate number of factors to extract is a critical step in EFA. Researchers often use eigenvalues as a cue to determine the number of factors to extract, similar to the Kaiser’s criterion and Scree plot used in PCA - but note that in EFA, this can be misleading as Eigenvalues now depend on the number of extracted factors. Also, by default, SPSS applies Kaiser’s criterion and the Scree plot to PCA Eigenvalues, even if you request EFA!\nAn alternative criterion for determining the number of factors is using theoretical knowledge to guide the decision. For example, if emotions are believed to break down into positive and negative emotions, we may choose to extract two factors. Additionally, the chi-square test can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of different factor solutions and assist in selecting the best-fitting model. To directly compare models, one can compute the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) - a relative model fit index designed for comparing models, which balances model fit and complexity. It is computed from the chi square as follows:\n\\[\nBIC = \\chi^2 - df ∗ log(n)\n\\]",

    "text": "18.7 EFA Assumption Checks\nBefore conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), it is good practice to perform several assumption checks to ensure the validity and appropriateness of the analysis. One critical aspect to consider is multicollinearity. While factor analysis aims to identify clusters of items that are correlated, excessive multicollinearity can lead to issues. This occurs when multiple items are perfectly linearly dependent, meaning that one item’s score can be exactly reproduced using other variables. In such cases, it becomes difficult to discern the unique contribution of collinear items to the underlying factor model. To detect multicollinearity, researchers can examine the determinant, a value between 0 and 1. It has been argued that the determinant should be greater than 0.00001, which indicates multicollinearity is not too high.\nAnother assumption check for EFA is the proportion of common variance among items. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic provides an estimate of this proportion. A higher KMO value indicates that more of the variance among items can be explained by common factors, making the data more suitable for factor analysis. Researchers can interpret the KMO value as follows:\n\n\nValue\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n0.00 to 0.49\nunacceptable\n\n\n0.50 to 0.59\nmiserable\n\n\n0.60 to 0.69\nmediocre\n\n\n0.70 to 0.79\nmiddling\n\n\n0.80 to 0.89\nmeritorious\n\n\n0.90 to 1.00\nmarvelous",

    "text": "18.8 Rotating Factor Loadings\nIn factor analysis, we aim to interpret the underlying structure of observed variables. The pattern of factor loadings is crucial in this process, helping us identify items that load highly on specific factors and potentially naming those factors based on high-loading indicators. In a perfect world, factor loadings would be clear and straightforward, with each item loading highly on only one factor. However, real-life factor loadings are not always so clear-cut, making interpretation more challenging.\nTo improve interpretability, we use rotation, which applies a linear transformation to the original factor loadings. Two main types of rotation are orthogonal and oblique rotation. Orthogonal rotation produces uncorrelated factors. The most common technique is VARIMAX rotation, which maximizes the variance of the squared loadings within each factor. Oblique rotation allows factors to correlate; the most common technique is oblimin rotation. In the social sciences, it is often sensible to allow factors to correlate (e.g., different personality dimensions are probably associated).\nOne-Factor EFA and One-Factor CFA:\nAlthough this course is not about confirmatory factor analysis, it is nevertheless useful to know that a one-factor EFA model is identical to a one-factor CFA model. In other words, if our theory implies a one-factor model, we can use exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to test that model. While EFA aims to identify underlying factors without any preconceived hypotheses about their association with items, CFA tests a hypothesized model - in this case, that one factor explains all item scores. CFA with ML estimation produces a chi-square test that can be used to assess model fit. Note, however, that this test can be sensitive to sample size and may reject good models. Researchers can also use the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) as an alternative model fit index, where values below 0.08 indicate good fit. RMSEA is calculated from the chi square as:\n\\[\nRMSEA = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\chi^2 - df}}{\\sqrt{(n - 1)*df}}\n\\]\nTreating a one-factor EFA as CFA also allows us to estimate latent variable reliability. Recall that Cronbach’s alpha assumes that all items are equally important. This means that it assumes that all factor loadings are the same. Factor analysis tests this assumption. Especially when factor loadings differ, it may be useful to compute latent variable reliability instead, using McDonald’s Omega (or composite reliability). It allows for different factor loadings, making it more appropriate for cases where items have varying contributions to the latent variable. The formula for McDonald’s Omega is:\n\\[\n\\omega = \\frac{SSL}{SSL+SSR} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Loadings}}{SSL + \\text{Sum of  Squared Residuals}}\n\\]\nCalculate SSL as: \\(SSL = (\\sum_{j=0}^k L_{1,k})^2\\) (first sum loadings, then square sum)\nCalculate SSR as: \\(SSR = 1-\\sum_{j=0}^k L_{1,k}^2\\) (first square loadings, then sum)",

    "section": "\n18.9 Estimating Factor Scores",
    "text": "18.9 Estimating Factor Scores\nIn many cases, researchers want to conduct further analyses using idividuals’ scores on components or latent variables. In previous sections, we learned about two common methods for obtaining scale scores from multiple items: sum scores and mean scores. In sum scores, we add up the responses from each item to create a total score for each individual. Similarly, in mean scores, we take the average of the responses from all items to obtain a score. In both cases, all items contribute equally to the final scale score. However, this approach assumes that all items are equally important, which might not always be the case. PCA and EFA both allow us to determine whether items are indeed equally important. We can also try to compute scale scores that take differences in item loadings into account.\nFor PCA, computing such scores is straightforward; these are simply given by multiplying the loadings for one component with the observed item scores. Since this is not a latent variable technique, there is only one possible solution to this calculation. To compute a PCA score for a specific individual, we multiply their standardized item scores by the corresponding factor loadings and then sum the results. For instance, if an individual has standardized item scores of 1, 3, and 2 on items with factor loadings of 0.85, 0.80, and 0.14, respectively, their PCA score would be calculated as \\((0.85 * 1 + 0.80 * 3 + 0.14 * 2) / (0.85^2 + 0.80^2 + 0.14^2) = 2.44\\). This score represents the individual’s relative level on the component.\nEstimating latent variable scores in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is more complex compared to PCA. Unlike PCA, which provides unique factor scores for each individual, EFA does not uniquely determined factor scores. An infinite number of latent variable datasets is consistent with the same EFA model. To estimate factor scores, researchers use methods like the regression method and the Bartlett method. The regression method involves ordinary least squares estimates and aims to maximize the multiple correlation between factor scores and common factors. However, these estimates are biased and the estimated factor scores correlate with one another and with the different latent variables. The Bartlett method produces factor scores that only correlate with their own latent variable but still correlate with estimated scores for other factors. Both methods thus have shortcomings. Some (see references below) have argued that it might be preferable to simply use mean scores instead of factor scores. In cases where factor loadings are approximately equal, this is probably fine.\nFurther reading:\nEveritt, B. S., & Howell, D. C. (2005). Encyclopedia of Statistics in Behavioral Science.

We use it when we want to summarize information in the items.\nEFA is used to identify latent variables underlying the measured items. EFA is typically used when a questionnaire has not been validated yet. When we use EFA, we usually do not know exactly which item belongs to which dimension (although we might have an idea based on our theory).\n\nDiscuss with your group: When do we use Confirmatory Factor Analysis?\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCFA is used when we DO know which items belong to which dimension.

    "text": "22.1 Confidence Intervals\nIn this assignment we will work on some questions regarding the confidence interval. We focus on the confidence interval around the mean, but everything you learn can also be applied to confidence intervals around the mean difference or regression coefficients.\nFinish the following sentence. The confidence interval around the mean is constructed around the \nSample mean\nPopulation mean (under H0)\nIn the population the variable IQ is normally distributed with \\(IQ \\sim N(\\mu=100, \\sigma=15\\).\nImagine that we drew 2000 samples from the population. For each of the samples we would calculate a 90% confidence interval around the sample mean. If you had to make a guess, how many intervals would you expect to contain the value 100? \nImagine we drew a sample from the population and we calculated the 95% confidence interval around the sample mean for a particular variable. The lower bound of the confidence interval is equal to 85 and the upper bound to 95.\nWhich of the following statements is correct?\n\nThere is a 95% probability that the population mean lies between 85 and 95.The probability that the population mean lies between 85 and 95 is 95%.There is a 95% probability that a confidence interval calculated based on a sample from this population contains the true population value.There is a 95% probability that if we would draw a new sample for the same population, the true population value lies between 85 and 95.\n\nConfidence intervals are interpreted in terms of long-run probability. IF we could draw a huge number of samples from the population, 95% of those samples would provide a confidence interval that contains the population mean.\nWe can never know whether one specific confidence interval contains the population value, however.\nSo we can NEVER draw a conclusion like “there is a 95% probability that the population mean lies between 85 and 95”.\nRecall the first lecture, in which I explained the idea of a “random experiment”. Think of a 95% confidence interval as a random experiment with a 95% probability of containing the population value. One specific confidence interval is not a random experiment. Whether the population mean lies within the interval is not a matter of probability. It either does or it does not. We just don’t know which of these is true.\nImagine a population with variable X, where \\(X \\sim N(\\mu 50, \\sigma = 10)\\)\nAssume a confidence level of 95% for all intervals.\nYou plan to draw a sample with \\(n=20\\) and compute a 95% confidence interval. What’s the probability that this interval will contain 50? %\nYour colleague has already drawn a sample of \\(n=20\\). What’s the probability that their confidence interval includes 50? \nCan’t say\n95%\n0%\n100%\nIf you would draw 20 samples, how many samples would you expect the confidence interval to contain the value 50? \nTrue or false: if you draw 100 samples, 95 of them will provide a confidence interval that contains the population value. \nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThis is false because the phrase “will provide” is not a probability statements, but a deterministic one.\n“The number of 95% confidence intervals out of 100 samples that contain the population value” is a random experiment. We expect an outcome of 95, but if we conduct this random experiment, the observed outcome may differ a little, e.g. 93, 94, 97 times are all fine.\n\nAll else being equal, what would you expect to happen to the confidence intervals of smaller samples? \nThey become narrower\nThey become wider\nThey stay the same\n\n\nExplanation\n\nBy increasing the sample size, our estimate becomes more precise. This will lead to more narrow confidence intervals.\nMathematically it also makes sense, because the confidence interval is based on the standard error. Remember that the formula for the standard error is \\(SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{n}\\) . A smaller sample size leads to a smaller standard error, which leads to a narrower interval.\nNote that this does affect the probability of confidence intervals containing \\(\\mu\\).\n\nIf the standard deviation increases (and everything else stays the same) the confidence interval will \nstay the same\nbecome narrower\nbecome wider.\nIf we change the confidence level to 90%, the interval will \nbecome narrower\nstay the same\nbecome wider and \nfewer\nmore\nthe same number of intervals will contain \\(\\mu\\).",

Empathy is a crucial element in appropriately responding to the emotions and actions of others. It is often described as the capacity to understand and share the emotional experiences of others, enabling us to comprehend and anticipate their intentions. Children who possess higher levels of empathy demonstrate greater emotional regulation and engage in more prosocial behavior towards others. This experimental study presented adolescents with either positive or negative social situations, and asked them to focus either on person A or person B in those situations (in negative situations, person A was the perpetrator and person B was the victim). They then measured how many coins participants were willing to give to the focal person. Empathy was measured using a scale with three sub-dimensions of empathy (Contagion, Understanding, and Support), and brain activation in several regions of interest was measured.\nReference: Overgaauw, S., Güroğlu, B., Rieffe, C., & Crone, E.
