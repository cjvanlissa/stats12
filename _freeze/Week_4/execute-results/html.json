The problem is not resolved by removing the word \"causes\":\n\n> 1. **Premise:** I observed a positive correlation between time spent studying and grades in my dataset  \n> 1. **Conclusion:** Therefore, time spent studying correlates positively with grades in the general population of students.\n\nIt follows that we can never conclusively \"prove\" general conclusions from specific observations.\nThe philosopher David Hume wrote extensively about this \"problem of induction\":\nHow can we justify the assumption that unobserved cases will follow the same patterns as observed ones?\nHume argued that this assumption cannot be logically justified.\nOur sense that generalization is justified might be based on intuition, but not logic.\nThe problem of induction challenges the very foundation of science.\nWe cannot escape the use of induction when seeking to learn general insights from specific observations,\nbut Hume showed that induction lacks a purely rational justification.\n\n### Falsificationism\n\nIt follows from the problem of induction that it is impossible to definitively prove a theory to be true.\nNo matter how much evidence I have observed that supports a theory (white swans),\nall it takes is one refuting observation (black swan) to reject is.\nKarl Popper sought to avoid the problem of induction by devising a scientific method that relies exclusively on deduction:\n[falsificationism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#PopFal).\nPopper demarcated the distinction between \"pseudo-science\" and science by arguing that *\"[scientific] statements [...] must be capable of conflicting with [...] observations\"* (Popper 1962, 39).\nThe core business of science, according to Popper, should be to try to reject theories.\nNote that - while Popper's work has been heavily criticized (for good reasons),\nhis work is very influential in social science.\nTherefore, Popper is a good *starting point* for our course - even though he probably should not be the *endpoint* for students with a genuine interest in philosophy of science.\n\n### Falsificationism and Hypothesis Testing\n\nThe idea of falsificationism has been very influential in applied statistics in the social sciences, particularly in the practice of \"Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing\" (NHST).\nIn NHST, researchers proceed as follows:\n\n1. Develop a testable proposition about a population parameter; for example:\n    + \"On average, my students understand the course material. Their mean grade is $\\mu \\geq 6$\".\n    + \"On average, there is a positive association between hours studied and grade, $\\rho \\geq 0$\".\n1. Develop a second hypothesis whose sole purpose is to be rejected, to pay lip service to falsificationism. Call this the \"null hypothesis\". The \"null hypothesis\" is often taken to be the exact opposite of the researcher's true belief, or \"alternative hypothesis\":\n    + \"On average, my students **DO NOT** understand the course material. Their mean grade is $\\mu < 6$\".\n    + \"On average, there is **NO** positive association between hours studied and grade, $\\rho < 0$\".\n1. Execute a procedure to make a decision to reject (falsify) or not reject the null hypothesis (next chapters).\n1. If the null hypothesis is rejected, act as if this finding supports the alternative hypothesis.\n\nAs argued by Andrew Gelman in [this blog post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/09/05/confirmationist-falsificationist-paradigms-science/), this approach only pays lip service to falsificationism.\nA true falsificationist would put their true belief (alternative hypothesis) to the test.\nFake falsificationism is creating a meaningless, \"straw man\" null-hypothesis, whose sole purpose is to be rejected.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nWhere does this leave us? The most important point is that there are important limitations to commonly used methods,\nincluding null-hypothesis significance testing.\nThere is no real satisfying solution.\nJust keep in mind that no statistical test can give evidence in support of a theory or hypothesis; neither a null nor an alternative hypothesis.\n\n### Causality\n\nAnother crucial philosophical issue relevant for statistics is the question of causality.\nScientists are often interested in causal questions.\nWe assume causality, for example, any time we want to *act on* knowledge derived from scientific research.\nFor example, say that I do find a strong correlation between hours studied and grade obtained.\nIf, based on this finding, you increase your study hours in order to improve your grade - then you are assuming causality.\nThe same applies for governments making evidence-based policy,\ncompanies adjusting sales strategies based on customer analytics,\nor drugs that replenish a particular neurotransmitter that has been found lacking in patients with a specific diagnosis.\n\nDespite the fact that causality is so important in scientific research,\nit is rarely defined.\nContemporary definitions are typically based on *counterfactuals*:\nA is a cause of B if B would not have happened if A had not happened.\nThis definition has important limitations, but it is sufficient for our course [@halpernModificationHalpernPearlDefinition2015].\n\nMost people have heard the phrase \"correlation does not imply causation\".\nWhat does this mean?\nOne important misunderstanding is that the *correlation coefficient* is an inappropriate statistic for investigating causal research questions.\nThis is not the case.\nThis phrase warns us that, just because observe a statistical association between variables X and Y (for example, a correlation of $r = .43$), that does not mean that X caused Y.\nImportantly, observing this correlation is consistent with a causal effect of X on Y - but also with other explanations.\nFor example, maybe Y caused X, or maybe a third variable caused both X and Y, and that is why they are correlated.\n\nThe problem is related to the previous section:\nobserving a pattern in data that is consistent with a causal association between X and Y cannot conclusively prove that X caused Y, no matter what statistic you use to describe the pattern.\n\nSo where does causality come from?\nThe short answer is: from theory or methodology.\nCausality can be assumed on theoretical grounds,\nor established using a randomized controlled experiment.\nIn such an experiment, researchers randomly assign participants to either an experimental condition (e.g., receiving a drug, instruction, treatment, et cetera), or a control condition (e.g., receiving a placebo, no instruction, non-effective treatment, et cetera).\nThe random assignment should, theoretically, result in two groups with no systematic differences that could explain between-group differences in the outcome of interest.\nOf course, due to pure chance, it could happen that there are systematic differences (more men in one group, taller people in one group, et cetera).\nBut there is no procedure that has a better chance of resulting in comparable groups than random assignment.\n\nIn the social sciences, experiments are not always feasible or ethical, so researchers often use observational data.\nDoes this preclude all causal claims?\nIt does not.\nIt is perfectly legitimate to present a theory that predicts a causal effect in the Introduction section of your scientific writing,\nand then present empirical data that show a pattern *consistent with* that effect.\nFor example, if I assume that hours studied causes improved grades,\na correlation of $r = .43$ is consistent with that assumption.\nAn alternative explanation might be that having receiving high grades in the past has motivated some students to study harder.\nJust make sure not to take the observed data as *evidence for* a causal effect.\n\nWhat is required to argue that X has a causal effect on Y?\nSeveral philosophers have addressed this issue; most notably Hume and Mill [see @morabiaHumeMillHill2013].\nThe necessary conditions for causality are sometimes summarized as association, temporal precedence, and non-spuriousness. Below, each is supported with quotes from [Hume (1902)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm), which were selected by [Aaron Peikert](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/103737):\n\n1. **Association**: Cause and effect must be associated (this could be statistical association)\n    + \"When one particular species of event has always [...] been conjoined with another, we [...] call the one object, Cause; the other, Effect.\" (VII, II, 59)\n    + \"familiar objects or events to be constantly conjoined together\" (V, I, 35)\nThere must be a \"constant union\" between cause and effect, and they must be \"contiguous in space and time\" (Hume 1739,16, pp. 173–175).\n1. **Temporal precedence**: The cause must occur before the effect.\n    + observe a continual succession of objects, and one event following another (V, I, 35)\n    + \"[when] the same object is always followed by the same event; we then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion.\" (VII, II, 61)\n1. **Non-spuriousness**: All alternative explanations of the effect are excluded. \n    + \"Their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual. There may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of the other.\" (describing spuriousness; V, I, 35)\n    + \"we may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed.\" (VII, II, 61)\n\nThis latter definition resembles the aforementioned counterfactual definition of causality.\nNote that this definition does not *require* randomized experimentation, but randomized experiments do help us meet all three criteria.\nThe field of *causal inference* focuses on developing methods that can estimate causal effects (like you would get from a randomized controlled experiment) from observational data [@pearlCausalInferenceStatistics2009].\n\n\n## Lecture\n\nTO DO\n\n<!-- {{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1J2Ge0B3Ro >}} -->\n\n## Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

Furthermore, a well-designed experiment ensures association (if there is an effect) and temporal precedence.\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Assignment 1: Induction and Deduction\n\nBelow are two texts like you might find in a social science publication.\nCarefully read both, and highlight examples of inductive- and deductive reasoning.\nThen discuss with your group mates:\n\na. Did you all highlight the same examples? Did you disagree about any of them?\na. Did you find examples of induction and deduction in both texts? Is one mode of reasoning more prominent in one text than the other?\na. Are all inductive and deductive inferences warranted? Do the fragments show sufficient awareness of the potential limitations of these modes of reasoning? Or conversely, are they *too* careful?\n\n**Fragment A**: \n\n> Using a cross‑sectional survey of adolescents from six urban schools (N = 2,184), we examined associations between evening screen time (self‑reported minutes after 8 p.m.) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Across schools and controlling for grade and gender, greater evening screen time was consistently associated with poorer sleep quality, r = .30, 95% CI [.25, .33]. Subgroup analyses by device type (phone vs. tablet) and by extracurricular workload yielded similar patterns. While these observational data cannot establish causation, finding a moderate effect across all schools suggests that higher evening screen exposure is related to adolescents' diminished sleep quality. Reducing evening device use could help improve adolescents' sleep outcomes.\n\n**Fragment B**: \n\n> Social norms theory posits that behavior is shaped by perceptions of typical peer behavior. We thus hypothesized that providing households with descriptive norm feedback about neighborhood electricity use would reduce individual electricity consumption, relative to a neutral informational control. We preregistered H1: households receiving monthly comparative reports will exhibit lower kWh usage over three billing cycles than controls. The null hypothesis H0 was that there was no difference between the experimental and control conditions. In a randomized field experiment (N = 3,042 households), treatment households received reports comparing their usage to that of \"similar homes\", alongside efficiency tips; control households received tips only. Mixed-effects models with random intercepts for household indicated a 2.4% reduction in usage for households in the experimental condition, $\\beta$ = −0.024, SE = 0.007, p < .001. We rejected the null hypothesis of no difference. These results are consistent with H1, indicating that social norms theory is a relevant framework for understanding household electricity consumption.\n\n\n### Assignment X: Causality\n\nBelow are five examples of statements from social scientific papers, courtesy of [Calvin Isch](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/calvin-isch).\n\na. First, read all the examples, and sort them into causal claims/non-causal claims. Discuss with your groupmates: did you classify each claim the same way? What makes the difference for you?\na. With your group, choose one of these claims and examine the associated paper. Discuss: \n    i. Do you still think the claim is causal/noncausal?\n    ii. Would a causal claim be justified in this case?\n    iii. Why/why not?\n\n**Example 1**: \n\n> Violence exposure hampers compromise among Israelis, emphasizing the importance of abstaining from violence for conflict resolution.\n\n<https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae581>\n\n**Example 2**:\n\n> We investigate both the role of gender and feminism in friends-with-benefits (FWB) relationships at a United States college, and ask whether identification with feminist ideology impacts students’ motivations and assessments of their relationships.\n\n<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-014-9252-3>\n\n**Exampe 3**:\n\n> This distrust of atheists is driven by religious predictors, social location, and broader value orientations.\n\n<https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100203>\n\n**Example 4**:\n\n> we show that being in a dual-career household increases one's willingness and lowers the perceived risk of leaving their job and joining a startup venture—especially if the household prioritizes their spouse's career.\n\n<https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3481>\n\n**Example 5**:\n\n> We find that those who live in regions with a greater share of migrants from Eastern Europe have more positive attitudes towards the EU but that this positive influence diminishes in highly segregated areas.\n\n<https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2023.2271504>\n\n",
