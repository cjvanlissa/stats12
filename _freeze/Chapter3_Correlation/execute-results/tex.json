Covariance reflects direction: it is positive when high values of *X* accompany high values of *Y*, and negative when they move in opposite directions. However, its numerical value is not directly interpretable because it is tied to the units of the measurement. A covariance expressed in centimeters and kilograms will differ from one computed in meters and pounds, even if the underlying association remains unchanged. As a result, covariance cannot meaningfully convey the *strength* of a relationship—only whether the variables tend to move in the same or opposite directions.\n\n\nIt provides a concise summary of the association between pairs of scores across individuals. For example, a researcher might retrieve each student’s high school GPA (a measure of academic performance) and pair it with their family’s annual income. The goal is to determine whether higher grades tend to correspond with higher income. In correlational studies, each individual contributes two measurements, commonly referred to as *X* and *Y* forming the foundation for analysis.\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a statistic that quantifies the strength and direction of association between two variables.\nIt tells us the degree to which two variables move together.\nOne way to think of the correlation coefficient is as a *bivariate (= two variables) descriptive statistic*.\n\nTo explore this relationship visually, researchers often rely on scatter plots. In a scatter plot, *X* values appear along the horizontal axis and *Y* values along the vertical. Each point on the plot corresponds to one participant’s pair of scores. These plots allow immediate detection of linear trends, and outliers—patterns that may remain obscured when examining data in purely numerical or tabular form.\n\n### Covariance\n\nThe word \"covariance\" means: varying, or moving, together.\nLet's have a look at mock data from five students on hours studied and final grade obtained:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2)\ngrads <- data.frame(\n  Hours = round(runif(5, 2, 20))\n)\ngrads$Grade <- round(scales::rescale(.7*grads$Hours + rnorm(5), to = c(1, 10)))\nknitr::kable(grads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Hours| Grade|\n|-----:|-----:|\n|     5|     3|\n|    15|     9|\n|    12|     6|\n|     5|     1|\n|    19|    10|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can visualize these data using a \"scatterplot\"; a simple graph where each observation is shown as a dot with X-coordinate determined by their value on the X variable (Hours), and Y-coordinate determined by the Y variable (Grade):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(grads, aes(x = Hours, y = Grade)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter3_Correlation_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-align='center' fig-pos='H' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, if you squint, it appears like there might be some pattern in the data: more hours studied tends to go hand in hand with a higher grade.\nThere might be a positive association between these variables!\nIn the next sections, we go about quantifying this association numerically, step by step.\n\n### Sum of Products (SP)\n\nThe first stage in quantifying the association between two variables is to compute the **sum of products of deviations** (SP).\nThe SP is similar to the sum of squares (SS),\nbut whereas the SS captures the variability of one variable,\nthe SP measures how two variables vary together.\n\nTo calculate the SP, take the following steps:\n\n##### Step 1: Calculate the variables' means\n\nTake the mean of each column (bold in the table below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nmns <- grads\nmns[] <- lapply(mns, as.character)\nmns <- rbind(mns, colMeans(grads))\nnames(mns) <- c(\"X\", \"Y\")\nkable(mns) |>\n  kable_styling() |>\n  row_spec(nrow(mns),bold=T,hline_after = T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{ll}\n\\toprule\nX & Y\\\\\n\\midrule\n5 & 3\\\\\n15 & 9\\\\\n12 & 6\\\\\n5 & 1\\\\\n19 & 10\\\\\n\\addlinespace\n\\textbf{11.2} & \\textbf{5.8}\\\\\n\\midrule\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Step 2: Calculate Deviations\n\nFor each variable, calculate the deviations by subtracting the mean from the observed scores:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\ndevs <- grads\ndevs <- cbind(devs, sweep(devs, 2, colMeans(devs)))\nnames(devs) <- c(\"X\", \"Y\", \"X-mean(X)\", \"Y-mean(Y)\")\nkable(devs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|  X|  Y| X-mean(X)| Y-mean(Y)|\n|--:|--:|---------:|---------:|\n|  5|  3|      -6.2|      -2.8|\n| 15|  9|       3.8|       3.2|\n| 12|  6|       0.8|       0.2|\n|  5|  1|      -6.2|      -4.8|\n| 19| 10|       7.8|       4.2|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Step 3: Multiply Deviations\n\nIf we were to calculate the SS, we would now square the deviations and add them up in each column.\nTo get the SP, instead of squaring the deviations - we multiply them across variables.\nNote that if the deviations for both variables have the same sign, then this will give a positive result (positive times positive is positive, and negative times negative is positive too).\nMoreover, if the deviations from both variables are high, the product will be a high number too.\nSo the SP tends to be a large positive number if high positive (or negative) deviations on one variable go hand in hand with high positive (or negative) deviations on the other variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprods <- devs\nprods <- cbind(prods, apply(devs[, 3:4], 1, prod))\nnames(prods)[5] <- \"Product\"\nkable(prods)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|  X|  Y| X-mean(X)| Y-mean(Y)| Product|\n|--:|--:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|  5|  3|      -6.2|      -2.8|   17.36|\n| 15|  9|       3.8|       3.2|   12.16|\n| 12|  6|       0.8|       0.2|    0.16|\n|  5|  1|      -6.2|      -4.8|   29.76|\n| 19| 10|       7.8|       4.2|   32.76|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we calculate the SP just by taking the sum of the column of products: 92.2.\n\nNote that if the SP is positive, then there is a positive association between the variables;\nif it is negative, there is a negative association.\nIn this case, the association is positive.\n\nHere is a formula describing what we just did: we took the sum $\\Sigma$ of the product $()()$ of the deviations of X from the mean of X, $X-\\bar{X}$ times the deviations of Y from the mean of Y, $Y-\\bar{Y}$:\n\n$$\nSP = \\sum \\bigl(X - \\bar{X}\\bigr)\\bigl(Y - \\bar{Y}\\bigr)\n$$\n\n\n#### Covariance\n\nTo get the covariance from the sum of products, we divide by the sample size, so in this case, $\\frac{92.2}{5}$.\n\nAnother way to think about this is: we standardize the SP by the sample size $n$.\nThis gives us the \"average co-deviation\" per participant.\nThat number is called the covariance.\n\nIf the covariance is positive, there is a positive association between the two variables.\nIf it is negative, there is a negative association.\n\nBut how strong is the association?\nIt is hard to say, because the *size* of the covariance depends on the units and scale of the two variables involved.\n\n### Correlation\n\nTo answer the question of how strong the association is,\nwe must standardize the covariance to drop the units of both variables.\nThis gives us the so-called **Pearson correlation coefficient (*r*)**.\nSpecifically, the covariance is divided by the product of the standard deviations of *X* and *Y*.\nThis standardization results in a number between -1 and +1, where 0 means no association, -1 means perfect negative association, and +1 means perfect positive association.\nThis number, the correlation coefficient, tells us both the **direction** (-/+) and **strength** (value) of association between two variables.\nBecause the correlation coefficients is unit-free, or standardized, it can also be compared across variables measured on different scales and across studies.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile correlation coefficients are useful,\nthey must be interpreted with care.\n\nTo illustrate the limitations of correlations, the statistician Anscombe (1973) created four data sets with identical correlation coefficients, $r = 0.82$.\nWhen plotting the data, however, it becomes clear that the correlation coefficient can only be meaningfully interpreted for the first dataset (figure a below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplts <- lapply(1:4, function(i){\n  df <- anscombe[, paste0(c(\"x\", \"y\"), i)]\n  names(df) <- c(\"X\", \"Y\")\n\n  ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill = \"orange\") + theme_linedraw()\n})\nggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = plts, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, labels = \"auto\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Anscombe's quartet, 1973](Chapter3_Correlation_files/figure-pdf/fig-anscombe-1.pdf){#fig-anscombe fig-align='center' fig-pos='H' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first and most important limitation is that, Pearson's correlation coefficient only meaningfully captures *linear associations*, or: patterns that look like a straight line.\nNote that figure a in @fig-anscombe shows such a linear pattern of association;\nthe correlation coefficient of $r = .82$ tells us that there is a strong - but not perfect - positive association.\n\nFigure b in @fig-anscombe , on the other hand, shows a *perfect non-linear* association.\nAll dots are perfectly in line; the line is just not straight.\nThis illustrates that Pearson's correlation coefficient is not suited for capturing non-linear patterns, even if a strong relationship exists in another form.\n\nFigure c shows a correlation of $r = 1$ for most of the points - but one outlier brings it down to $r = .82$.\n\nFigure d shows no association at all for most of the points (they all have the same value for X, and if X does not vary, it cannot covary/correlate with Y) - but a single outlier makes it look like there is a strong correlation..\n\nSecondly, these plots illustrate that **outliers** can have a disproportionate impact.\nIn figures c and d, a single extreme observation artificially deflates (c) or inflates (d) the correlation coefficient,\npotentially leading to misleading conclusions.\n\nThirdly, a **restricted range** of scores can obscure or distort relationships.\nFor example, if you were to examine the pattern in figure b of @fig-anscombe for values of X between [4, 9], you would conclude that $r = 0.99$, or near perfect positive correlation.\nIf you examined the same pattern for values of X between (0, 13), you would conclude that $r = -0.07$, or near-zero.\nIf you examined the same pattern for values of X between [13, 20), you would conclude that $r = -1.00$, or perfect negative correlation.\nFigure @fig-nonlin below zooms into the pattern from figure b, by restricting the range of variable X into three segments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- anscombe[, paste0(c(\"x\", \"y\"), 2)]\nnames(df) <- c(\"X\", \"Y\")\np1 <- ggplot(df[df$X <= 9, ], aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill = \"orange\") + theme_linedraw()+ geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\np2 <- ggplot(df[df$X > 9 & df$X < 13, ], aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill = \"orange\") + theme_linedraw() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\np3 <- ggplot(df[df$X >= 13, ], aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill = \"orange\") + theme_linedraw() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\nggpubr::ggarrange(p1,p2,p3, ncol = 3, nrow = 1, labels = \"auto\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Zooming in on panel b of Anscombe's quartet, restricting the range of X](Chapter3_Correlation_files/figure-pdf/fig-nonlin-1.pdf){#fig-nonlin fig-align='center' fig-pos='H' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestriction of range can easily happen in real life.\nFor example, if your sample only consists of university students, you will probably have restriction of range on IQ.\n\nFinally, you may have heard the phrase **correlation does not imply causation**.\nObserving a strong association between two variables does not mean that one causes the other.\nIn general, it is not possible to conclude causality from statistics:\ncausality is an assumption, which can be either supported by a theory,\nor by a particular methodology.\nIn a randomized controlled experiment, participants are randomly assigned to receive either a treatment or control condition.\nThus, any differences between the two groups should be due to the experimental treatment, or random chance.\nWe will revisit the topic of causality later.\n\nAnscombe's quartet is a good illustration of the limitations of causality, and also demonstrates the value of **visually inspecting your data (including with  scatter plots)** before interpreting any statistics.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, **covariance** offers an initial metric for gauging whether two variables tend to vary in the same or opposite direction. However, because its magnitude depends on the measurement units of the variables involved, it cannot be directly interpreted in terms of strength. The **Pearson correlation coefficient (*r*)** addresses this limitation by standardizing the covariance, yielding a unit-free statistic bounded between –1 and +1. This standardized measure expresses both the **direction** and **strength** of a linear relationship, enabling meaningful comparisons across contexts. Nevertheless, interpreting correlations requires caution, particularly with respect to restricted sampling ranges, the influence of outliers, and the fundamental distinction between correlation and causation.\n\n## Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNI0YNjpvHs?si=hSdVTaoX1geeVMzn >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Formative Test\n\nThis short quiz checks your grasp of **Chapter 3 – Covariance & Correlation**.  \nWork through it after you’ve studied the lecture slides (and before the next live session) so we can focus on anything that still feels uncertain.
