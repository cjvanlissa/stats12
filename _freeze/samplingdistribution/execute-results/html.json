The discrepancy between the sample statistic and population parameter is known as sampling error.\n\nWe have some theoretical insight into theoretical behavior of sample statistics.\nFor example, we can imagine constructing a probability distribution of the values we might see for a sample statistic, such as the mean, if we were to draw very many random samples from an identical population.\nThis theoretical distribution of means is called the sampling distribution.\nThe central limit theorem tells us that, regardless of the shape of the distribution of the data in the population, as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution.\nThis is an important realization, because it means that we can use probability calculus using the normal distribution to draw inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution plays a central role in inferential statistics.\nIt is so important that we give it a unique name: we call this particular standard deviation the *standard error* (SE).\nThe standard error quantifies the average, or expected, amount of sampling error when we use a sample statistic to estimate the population parameter.\nIf the standard error is small, our estimates based on the sample are likely to be accurate, whereas a large standard error indicates greater uncertainty.\n\nWith the help of the normal distribution,\nand given a particular (hypothesized or known) population mean and standard error,\nwe can calculate how likely it is to observe specific sample means.\nFor example, if we want to determine the probability that the mean of a random sample exceeds a certain value, we can standardize the sample mean using the formula $Z = \\frac{M - \\mu}{SE_M}$, where M is the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the known or hypothesized population mean,\nand SE is the standard error.\nBy looking up the corresponding probability on the standard normal distribution table or using statistical software, we can assess the likelihood of observing a specific sample mean (or greater, or smaller).\n\nConfidence intervals are a way to express our uncertainty about the sample statistic as estimator of the population parameter.\nA confidence interval is a range of values - a window - within which we expect the true population parameter to fall with a certain level of confidence.\nTypically, we select a 95% confidence interval, which means that if we could repeat the sampling process many times and calculated confidence intervals each time, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\nThe width of the confidence interval is determined by the standard error and is proportional to the level of confidence desired.\nThe formula for a confidence interval is often written as:\n$M \\pm Z_{95\\%} * SE_M$.\nIn practice, this comes down to approximately: $M \\pm 2 * SE_M$.\n\n## Lecture\n\n**VIDEO ERRATA: from 19:40 - 19:50 I incorrectly report the probability of P(Z > 1) as .025, but it is .16.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNxF0Tr6R9M >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_FDFFOGYEQY'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FDFFOGYEQY\" value=\"\"></input> <span>0.283</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FDFFOGYEQY\" value=\"\"></input> <span>0.0707</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FDFFOGYEQY\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>0.707</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FDFFOGYEQY\" value=\"\"></input> <span>0.141</span></label></div>\n\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Show explanations</button>\n**Question 1**\n\nCalculate the standard error as 10/sqrt(16). Then, calculate the Z-score as (52-50)/SE. Find the right tailed probability of that Z-score, then calculate 1 minus that probability.\n\n**Question 2**\n\n The sampling distribution will be approximately normal because n >= 30. The SE is indeed 1, because sigma/sqrt(n) = 6 /sqrt(36) = 1. The SE is always smaller than sigma, because it is calculated as sigma divided by square root of n.\n\n**Question 3**\n\nThe sampling distribution represents the distribution of sample statistics, such as sample means or proportions, derived from multiple samples drawn from the same population. It provides insights into the variability and characteristics of these sample statistics.\n\n**Question 4**\n\nThe sampling distribution is centered around the population parameter.\n\n**Question 5**\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution is known as the standard error. It measures the average variability or spread of sample statistics around the population parameter, reflecting the precision of the estimation.\n\n**Question 6**\n\nLarger sample sizes result in smaller standard errors. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more concentrated around the population parameter, leading to a decrease in the standard error. This implies that larger samples provide more precise estimates of the population parameter.\n\n**Question 7**\n\nThe probability that a sample mean falls within +/- 1 standard deviations of the population mean, assuming a normal distribution of sample means, is 68%. This is based on 'the empirical rule'.\n\n**Question 8**\n\nThe standard error of the sample mean is 2. The standard error can be calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the population by the square root of the sample size. In this case, it would be 10 / âˆš25 = 2.\n\n**Question 9**\n\nThe key lesson here is that everything you learned about the sampling distribution also applies to other statistics than the mean, so according to the empirical rule, 95% of sample proportions will fall within +/- 2 standard deviation of the population proportion.\n\n**Question 10**\n\nThe standard error of the sample mean is SD/sqrt(n), so 5/sqrt(50) = .707\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Sampling Distribution\n\nComplete the following sentences:\n\nIQ scores in the population of potential students are normally distributed with mean 120 and an SD of 10.\nIf a cohort contains 75 students, 95% of cohorts will have an average IQ in between <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>117.69</option><option value=''>118.27</option><option value=''>100</option><option value=''>118.85</option></select> and <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>121.15</option><option value=''>130</option><option value='answer'>122.31</option><option value=''>121.73</option></select>.\n\nAfter graduating, a cohort of 75 LAS students can expect to earn a starter salary of 2650 Euros, with an SD of 300 euros.

Note that we have data about biometric differences (e.g., age, height, shoesize), as well as school-related questions (which program they are enrolled in), variables about their love for statistics, and about moral preferences (based on the \"Morality As Cooperation\" questionnaire that I helped develop).\n\nGo to Analyze -> Descriptives and ask for descriptive statistics on height and shoesize. Click Options, and notice that there's an option to request the standard error of the mean. Select this option, then paste and run your syntax. Check if it corresponds to the syntax below.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\n```\nDESCRIPTIVES VARIABLES=height\n  /STATISTICS=MEAN STDDEV MIN MAX SEMEAN.\n```\n\nNote the `SEMEAN` option was added by clicking that option!\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nThe mean length in the population of Dutch people is 177.434.

It's not very common, in fact I learned about it by Googling \"standard error for proportion spss\"! Any time you need to know how to do something in SPSS, you can find advice on the internet.\n\nCalculate the proportion for the variable sex, and paste and run your syntax.\n\n\n```\n\nPROPORTIONS\n  /ONESAMPLE sex TESTVAL=0.5 TESTTYPES=MIDP SCORE  CITYPES=AGRESTI_COULL JEFFREYS WILSON_SCORE \n  /SUCCESS VALUE=LAST\n  /CRITERIA CILEVEL=95\n  /MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS USERMISSING=EXCLUDE.\n```\n\n<!-- Note the argument `TESTVAL=0.5`. Looking at the output, what do you think this means? -->\n\nNote the table labelled \"One-Sample Proportions Confidence Intervals\". This table contains confidence intervals for the proportion, calculated according to three different procedures. In the lecture, you also learned a procedure to calculate confidence intervals.\n\nUsing the procedure from the lecture, calculate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion. You can round the Z-score for this confidence interval to 2.\n\nThe 95% CI for the proportion of male students is [<input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.359\",\".359\"]'/>, <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.507\",\".507\"]'/>].\n\nNote that the differences between this procedure and the three procedures in the table only differ in the third decimal.\n\nHow do you interpret a confidence interval? \n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_NEDSRLXTEH'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_NEDSRLXTEH\" value=\"\"></input> <span>A range of values that contains the population parameter with 95% certainty.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_NEDSRLXTEH\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>A range of values that, 95% of the time, contains the population parameter.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_NEDSRLXTEH\" value=\"\"></input> <span>The population value, with a 95% margin of error.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_NEDSRLXTEH\" value=\"\"></input> <span>The range of likely population values.</span></label></div>\n\n\n#### SE for Correlation\n\nRecall from the first lecture that the correlation coefficient is a measure of linear association between two variables, or: a descriptive statistic that describes how strongly two continuous variables are associated.\n\nGo to Analyze -> Correlate -> Bivariate.
