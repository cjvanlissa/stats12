We live in a world where organizations large and small collect data to tailor products and services, and being data literate is becoming increasingly important across industries.\n\nStatistics allows us to make sense of data and gain valuable insights. It helps us better understand social phenomena, predict sales and optimize marketing strategies, and even explore the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Data analysis is one of the most marketable skills taught at universities.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into statistics, it's crucial to distinguish between methods and statistics. Methods refer to the procedures used in research, such as data collection, participant selection, and study design. Statistics, on the other hand, focuses on analyzing the data obtained from these methods.\n\nTwo fundamental branches of statistics covered in this course are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset, while inferential statistics allows us to make educated guesses about a larger population based on a smaller sample.\n\nStatistical modeling is another aspect of statistics where theories are represented mathematically. This enables us to predict important outcomes, such as sales figures, well-being, or the likelihood of neurological disorders. Statistical modeling also allows us to explore data for interesting patterns or to perform tests to answer theoretically driven research questions.\n\nIn scientific research, statistics can help us test theories. The process of scientific knowledge acquisition is described by the empirical cycle: We start with a theory, from which we derive testable hypotheses. A theory is an abstract system of assumptions about the relationships between constructs. A hypothesis is a concrete statement, derived from the theory, about expected quantitative relationships between measured variables. We then collect data and test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is refuted, we re-examine the theory and possibly amend it.\n\nTo lay a foundation for understanding statistics, it's essential to be familiar with some basic concepts. First, data in the social sciences often come in tabular format (e.g., spreadsheets), where each row represents an individual observation, and each column represents the individuals' scores on various variables.\n\nA crucial distinction is the one between population and sample. The population refers to the complete set of objects of interest, such as all people in a country or all students in a class. However, due to practical limitations, we usually do not have access to the population. Instead, we draw a sample from it, which is a subset of the population. Sampling theory establishes the rationale for drawing inferences about a population based on samples. Sample statistics serve as our best estimate of population parameters. If the sample is representative, those estimates will be unbiased. Moreover, we can estimate our uncertainty about the sample statistics as estimates of population parameters. The best way to ensure a representative sample is to use random sampling, where each individual in the population has an equal chance of being included—though in practice, constraints often lead researchers to rely on convenience or stratified sampling, which can limit the strength of our inferences.\n\nThe distinction between constructs and variables is also important. Constructs are abstract features of interest within a population, like short-term memory, intelligence, or education. Variables, on the other hand, are placeholders that represent specific values associated with these constructs—much like column headers in a spreadsheet. Data then refer to the specific values of a variable.\n\nMeasurement level refers to the kind of information contained in a variable. The four common measurement levels are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Nominal variables have categories that differ in name only, while ordinal variables have categories with a meaningful order. Interval variables have meaningful intervals between values (e.g., temperature in °C), which allows for meaningful comparisons between values. Finally, ratio variables have a meaningful zero-point (e.g., weight in kilograms), which additionally allows for the computation of meaningful ratios between values.\n\nDescriptive statistics are used to summarize and analyze data. They help us get a sense of the dataset and answer questions like the most common major among students or the average age of a group. Descriptive statistics can also be relevant in answering research questions, such as evaluating exam questions or determining if the proportion of correct answers on a multiple-choice question is greater than chance.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nBefore applying statistical tests, researchers typically engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA): visualizing and summarizing the data to detect errors, spot patterns, and generate new questions. This step—popularized by John Tukey—often involves histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots that reveal outliers or interesting trends worth modeling.\n\n## Correlation ≠ Causation\nBecause patterns can be visually compelling, it is crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation. For instance, ice-cream sales and drowning deaths rise together in summer, but purchasing ice-cream does not cause drowning. Establishing causal claims requires careful design and statistical control.\n\n## Research Designs and Validity\nResearchers employ several designs—experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational—each with its own strengths and limitations. Two key pillars of quality are:\n\nInternal validity: the degree to which the study rules out alternative explanations, letting us attribute observed effects to the manipulated variables rather than confounds.\n\nExternal validity: the extent to which findings generalize beyond the specific sample, setting, and operationalizations used in the study.\n\nA tightly controlled laboratory experiment may score high on internal validity but lower on external validity, whereas a large-scale field survey often shows the opposite pattern. Balancing both is a central concern of scientific inquiry.\n\n## Sampling Distribution and Standard Error\nIf we could repeatedly draw many random samples of the same size from a population, each sample statistic (e.g., a mean) would vary. The distribution of those statistics is called the sampling distribution, and its spread is summarized by the standard error. Understanding this concept allows us to place confidence intervals around estimates and to perform hypothesis tests.\n\n## Ethics, Privacy, and Reproducible Workflows\nModern data analysis carries ethical responsibilities: protecting participant privacy, preregistering hypotheses, and sharing code to enable reproducibility. Tools like R Markdown (and its successor, Quarto) combine prose, code, and output in a single document, ensuring that results can be regenerated with a single click—an increasingly important professional standard.\n\nIn summary, statistics is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting data. It helps us gain insights into various aspects of social life, make predictions, and test theories. By understanding fundamental concepts—such as measurement levels, internal and external validity, and descriptive versus inferential statistics—and by adopting good practices like EDA, ethical data handling, and reproducible workflows, we can start exploring and making sense of data in a meaningful way.\n\n# Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/_TZIIANBt94 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

So calculate:<br>$S_{X}^2= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \\frac{(7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 8)}{5} = 7$\n\n**Question 7**\n\n First rule out improbable answers;  the variance is not a measure of central tendency, and all grades are pretty close to each other, so it would be impossible for the variance to be that high. We can see what the mode (most common value) is: it's 8. So we only choose between mean or median. <br>Mean: calculate $\\bar{X}= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \\frac{8 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{6} = 7.17$<br>Median: order the numbers, note that there is an odd number, take the average of the two middle numbers. 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9 -> 7.5\n\n**Question 8**\n\n Correlation measures linear association, so eliminate option C. Option B shows a very small correlation - probably 0 or maybe .1. So the correct answer is A, which shows a moderate negative correlation.\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-scatter layout-ncol=3}\n\n![A](images/lecture 73.png){width = 30%}\n\n![B](images/lecture 74.png){width = 30%}\n\n![C](images/lecture 76.png){width = 30%}\n\nScatterplots\n\n:::\n\n# In SPSS\n\n## Frequency Distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1ER4MAngFE >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXG7HWGdKNk >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Bar Charts and Histograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NeaD1Mojp0 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introducing SPSS\n\nWelcome everyone to your first lab session for Statistics 1 and 2. Today, we start working with an introduction to SPSS and we calculate a few basic descriptive statistics.\n\nEach lab session consists of several assignments and includes explanations on how to carry out the analyses in SPSS.\n\nYou can work at your own pace. If you experience any problems, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask your teacher.\n\nYou will receive feedback to your answers after you have submitted the practical.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Step  1\n\nHi there!\n\nDuring the lab sessions of this course you will learn how to work with the statistics program IBM SPSS (SPSS for short).\n\nBackground information is given throughout the exercises. We will occasionally refer to additional reading materials for this course, or other sources (e.g., youtube videos).\n\nIf you’re working from a student workplace, SPSS is already installed. If you’re working from your own computer, you either have to purchase SPSS, or you can use a free alternative (see @sec-software) - but note that, at this point, the instruction text is still focused on SPSS so if there are any differences it will be your responsibility to figure out how to use your software.\n\nYour first task is to start the SPSS program. You can easily find SPSS via the Windows Start Menu. SPSS may ask about the coding: use Unicode (button to the left). Then there may be another window open that you can close. In the end you should see an empty spread sheet.\n \n### Step  2\n\nNow you’ve got SPSS running, we’re ready to go!\n\nWe will start with a number of introductory exercises using the data file `stressLAS.sav`. To obtain this and other tutorial data files, download the GitBook, and open the `data` folder to find all files.\n\nOpen the file in SPSS. Proceed as follows: via the op menu follow the route: File -> open -> data. SPSS now opens a new window. Search for the file StressLAS.sav and open the file in SPSS.\n\n\n \n### Step  3\n\nThe file contains data about a study on - you guessed it - stress.\n\nMore precisely, it contains data on the following variables:\n\n- `stress`: Measures whether the participant experiences stress, and where the stress comes from.\n- `smoke`: Measures the smoking behavior of the participant.\n- `relation`: Whether or not the participant is involved in a long-term romantic relationship.\n- `optim`: Measures how optimistic the participant is on a scale of 0 to 50.\n- `satis`: Measures of life satisfaction of the participant on a scale of 0 to 50.\n- `negemo`: The amount of negative emotions on a scale of 0 to 50.\n \n### Step  4\n\nAfter opening the data file, you will see the tabs Data View and Variable View at the bottom of your screen.\n\nMake sure the tab Data View is selected.\n\nLook at the Data View and describe the data file. What do the rows represent, and what do the columns represent?\n\n \n### Step  5\n\nNow switch to the Variable View tab.\n\nThe Variable View lists the variables and their properties. We will not discuss all the columns in detail, but focus on the most important ones, which includes: name, label, values, and measure.\n\nExplain for each of the columns name, label, values, and measure what aspect of the variable it describes. Also explain the difference between variable name and variable label.\n\n \n### Step  6\n\nValue Labels\n\nFor nominal and ordinal variables we have to indicate what the scores represent; that is, we have to assign so called value labels. Value labels are specified under Values.\n\nIf you click on values for the variable of interest, and then on the blue button with the three dots on the right, SPSS opens a new window that allows you to view, define, or modify the value labels.\n\n\nWhat are the value labels for the Stress and what are they for Smoke?\n\n \n### Step 6a\n\nYou may have noticed that the value labels are missing for the nominal variable Relation.\n\n\nAdd the value labels yourself in SPSS such that a score 1 represents “Single” and 2 represents “In a relationship”.\n\n \n### Step  7\n\nEvery variable has a so-called Measurement Level.\n\nFirst, summarize the measurement levels in your own words (as if you have to explain it to a fellow student). Then, indicate the measurement level for each of the variables of interest (Stress, Smoking, etc.).\n\n### Step 8\n\nCongratulations, you have completed your first assignment! \n\nBefore we proceed make sure that you save the data file (via file > save). Because you changed the data, it is important to save the file under a different name. This way, you don't risk losing the original data.\n\nIn the next assignment we will generate descriptive statistics for this data.\n\n\n## Plotting data\n\n### Step 1\n\nThe first step in any statistical analysis involves inspection of the data at hand by means of descriptive statistics and/or graphical summaries. Descriptive statistics include the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value. Examples of graphical summaries are bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.\n\nIn this assignment we will look at graphical summaries. In particular, we will look at three: bar charts, histogram, and scatter plots.\n\nYou may use the same data file as for the previous assignments.\n\n### Step 2\n\nFirst, we will create a bar chart for Stress.\n\nProceed as follows:\n\nGraphs > legacy dialogs > bar\nSelect Simple and click on define\nSelect Stress under Category Axis (i.e., the variable at the x-axis)\nThen Click on OK and consult the graph in the output\n\n### Step 3\n\nYou may have noticed that SPSS by default creates a bar chart with the observed frequency depicted on the y-axis. We will now create a new bar chart and instead ask SPSS to show the percentages on the y-axis.\n\nProceed as follows:\n\nGraphs > Legacy Dialogs > Bar\nAgain choose Simple and click on Define\nUnder “Bars represent” choose “% of cases”\nClick on OK.\nSPSS will now create a bar chart, where the heights of the bars represent percentages.\n\n### Step 4\n\nNext, we will create a histogram for Negative Emotions.\n\nProceed as follows:\n\nGraph > Legacy Dialogs > Histogram\nSelect Negative Emotions under variable, and ask SPSS to Display normal curve (check the box).\nClick on OK.\n \n\nInvestigate the histogram; What is shown on the x-axis and what is shown on the y-axis?\n\nHow to read the histogram:\n\n* x-axis: the scores on the negative emotions (here numbers between 0 and 50).\nbars represent score ranges; the more respondents with a score in that range, the higher the bar.\n* y-axis: the observed number of respondents per score range.\n \n\n### Step 5\n\nFinally, we will create a scatter plot for Negative Emotions and Life Satisfaction. Scatter plots are very useful to get a first impression of whether variables are associated.\n\nCreate a scatter plot as follows:\n\nGraphs > legacy dialogs > scatter/dot\nChoose Simple Scatter\nSelect Negative Emotions on the x-axis, and Life Satisfaction on the y-axis\nClick OK\n\nConsult the output. Look at the scatter plot and see if you understand the graph.\n\nHow to read a scatter plot:\n\n* x-axis represents the scores on Negative Emotions.\n* y-axis represents the scores on Life Satisfaction.\n* Each dot in the graph is a case, representing how the case scores on both Negative Emotions and Life Satisfaction. \n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nDescribe the first bar chart; What is shown on the x-axis? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Frequency of Responses</option><option value=''>Percentages of Responses</option><option value=''>Numeric scores of Stress</option><option value='answer'>Categories of Stress</option></select>\n\nIn the first bar chart, what is shown on the y-axis? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Numeric scores of Stress</option><option value='answer'>Frequency of Responses</option><option value=''>Categories of Stress</option><option value=''>Percentages of Responses</option></select>\n\nWhat's the approximate proportion of people experiencing work-related stress? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>70%</option><option value='answer'>33%</option><option value=''>66%</option></select>\n\nBased on the bar charts, what can you say about differences in stress levels in the sample?

In the previous assignment we looked at graphical summaries.\n\nThis assignment shows you how to explore data using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics include values such as the mean, standard deviation, the maximum value and the minimum value.\n\nUse the same data file as for the previous assignments.\n\n\n### Step 2\n\nWe will first take a look at the descriptive statistics for Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Negative Emotions.\n\nCompute descriptive statistics as follows:\n\nAnalyze > Descriptive Statistics > Descriptives\n\nSelect the variables Optimism, Life Satisfaction and Negative Emotions\nNow click on OK\nSPSS will open a new window - the output window - including a table with the descriptives for the selected variables.\n\n\n### Step 3\n\nIn the previous step we computed the average value and standard deviations. However, for nominal and ordinal variables, the average value is meaningless. To explore nominal and ordinal variables we may produce Frequency tables. A frequency table shows the observed percentage for each level of the variable.\n\nLet's generate a frequency table for variables Smoke and Relation.\n\nAnalyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies\n\nSelect the variables for which you want to have the frequency distribution (i.e., Smoke and Relation)\nClick OK.\nSPSS now adds a table with the frequency distributions of the selected variables to the output file.\n\nNote: SPSS reports percentages and valid percentages. Percentages differ when there are missing values. Because we don’t have missing values here, the numbers are the same. Missing values will be discussed in the next assignment. \n\n\n<!-- source of stress (stress): 1 = no stress; 2 = work-related stress; 3 = personal-life stress. -->\n<!-- smoking behavior (smoke) 1 = non-smoker; 2 = smoker; -->\n<!-- being in a significant relationship (relation): 1 = single; 2 = relationship. -->\n<!-- optimism (optim): scale scores between 1 and 50. -->\n<!-- life satisfaction (satis): scale scores between 1 and 50. -->\n<!-- negative emotions (negemo): scale scores between 1 and 50. -->\n\n\n<!-- ### Step 5 -->\n\n<!-- You may have noticed that the maximum value for Optimism was 220, which is not allowed (scores should be in between 0 and 50).

Erroneous values are values that are out of range, or impossible given the variable envisaged. For example, a person may have mistyped his/her age (e.g., 511 instead of 51).\n\nNow it’s your task to check for each variable whether there are erroneous values (out of range values) in the file using descriptive statistics and/or graphs.\n\nUse the descriptive statistics to find any erroneous values.\n\nOne way to deal with missing values is by removing the entire case. This is not a recommended practice; however, at this point, it is the only method you have learned.\n\nTo find the cases that have missing values you may sort the data file on a variable with suspect values from high to low (or low to high).\n\nThis can be done as follows:\n\nData > Sort Cases\nSelect the variable on which cases should be sorted\nSelect the cases in descending order\nClick on OK\nGo the data view and verify that the cases are now ordered.\n\nRemove the case(s) (i.e., delete the row from the data file) with invalid values.\n\n### Step 5\n\nNow that we’ve \"cleaned\" the data file it’s time to answer our first research question!\n\nThe question is: “Are non-smokers in our sample on average more satisfied with their life than smokers?”\n\nTo answer this question, we need the mean of life satisfaction per smoking group. In order to generate those, we will use the Split File option in SPSS. This is an option in SPSS that allows us to get results for separate groups.\n\nData > Split File > Compare Groups\nSelect the groups based on the variable Smoke\nClick OK\n\nNotice that you don’t see any changes in the data file or anything in the output file yet (!). However, after running the Split file command, SPSS from now will do the analyses per group, as we will see next.\n\nCompute the mean of Life Satisfaction (via descriptive statistics) and consult the output.\n\nYou may notice that SPSS provides the means of the non-smoking and smoking group separately. Compare the means for both groups to answer the following questions.\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nWas there an erroneous value in the data file? If so, type the value of that erroneous value here: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='3' data-answer='[\"220\"]'/>\n\nTo answer this question, only use reasoning. If you delete that value,\nhow do you think the mean of that variable will be affected? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Becomes larger</option><option value='answer'>Becomes smaller</option><option value=''>Stays the same</option></select>\n\nTo answer this question, only use reasoning. If you delete that value,\nhow do you think the standard deviation of that variable will be affected? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Becomes smaller</option><option value=''>Becomes larger</option><option value=''>Stays the same</option></select>\n\nTo answer this question, only use reasoning. If you delete that value,\nhow do you think the standard deviation of that variable will be affected? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Becomes smaller</option><option value=''>Becomes larger</option><option value=''>Stays the same</option></select>\n\nIn this sample, who are more satisfied with life? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Non-smokers</option><option value='answer'>Smokers</option></select>\n\nDo you think this also holds for the population of all persons? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Can't tell</option><option value=''>Yes</option><option value=''>No</option></select>\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Missing Values\n\nThis is a short assignment about missing values.\n\nMissing values are 'holes in the data matrix'. Missing data is a common issue in empirical research. Respondents may forget to fill in questions or refuse to answer questions (if the latter is the case, we are in trouble). It is important that missing data are adequately handled in data analysis.\n\nUse the same data file as for the previous assignments.\n\nIn the previous assignment we activated the split file option. However, we don’t need this split file in the remaining questions, therefore we have to undo the split file option.\n\nData > split file\nChoose “Analyze all cases, do not create groups”\n \nCompute the frequency distribution of stress. Consult the output, and answer the following questions\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nWhat is the percentage of respondents who experience No Stress? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"33.6\"]'/>\n\nWhich type of stress is most common in the sample? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>No stress</option><option value=''>Work stress</option><option value='answer'>Life stress</option></select>\n\n**For educational purposes only, we will now create missing values in the data file.**\n\nNavigate to the Data view and delete the value for Stress for the first 10 cases. Notice that you only have to delete the scores for the variable Stress, and not the complete case.\n\nCompute the frequency distribution for Stress again and compare the new table with the previous one.\n\nExplain what has changed and why.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\n*We can see that the values of Percent and Valid Percent have changed and that a ‘missing’ row has been added to the table. It makes sense that the percentages have changed, as there are now missing values. You may have noticed that the values for Percent and Valid Percent differ. Percentage is obtained by dividing the observed frequency by the total  (including respondents with a missing value). Valid Percentage is obtained by dividing the observed frequency by the number of respondents with a valid score (thus, not counting the respondents who had a missing value).*\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nImagine I have a sample of 65 participants, with 3 missing value. Of these participants, 15 reported no stress. What is the percentage of no stress, calculated by hand? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"23.1\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the percentage out of valid responses (i.e., valid percent), calculated by hand? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"24.2\"]'/>\n\n\n:::\n\n\nBy deleting the values we created empty cells in the data file.\nSPSS sees these empty cells as *system missing*. Some researchers instead use specific values to indicate missing values. For example, we may code missing values by 999 if the respondent *refused* to answer, and 998 if the respondent *accidentally* skipped the question. These are examples of *user missing* values, and we have to specify the values to be coded as missing in the Variable view.\n\nLet's try this!\n\nGo to the Data View, and fill in 999 in the cells that have no value on the variable Stress.\nThen go to the variable view, look for the column 'Missing' and click on Missing for Stress. A new window opens.\nSpecify 999 as a discrete missing value. SPSS now knows that the value 999 stands for “missing observation”.\nClick OK.\n \nRe-compute the frequency distribution for Stress.\n\n\nExamine how the table changed compared to the previous ones.\n\n \n## More Descriptive Statistics\n\nIn this final assignment, we will continue with descriptive statistics.\n\nAs mentioned in the lecture, describing the data is an important first step in any research situation.\n\nFor didactic reasons, we will do some computations by hand, but this is not something you have to do on the exam. However, it is good to experience at least once how the computations work and that the numbers in SPSS are not the result of magic.\n\nLet’s first look at measures of central tendency:\n\nConsider the following grades for 10 students: 6, 3, 4, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 9.\n\nCompute (by hand) the mean, median, and mode.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Remind me how</button>\n\n* The mode is the most common value.\n* The median is the middle value (or mean of two middle values for an equal number)\n* The mean is calculated as the sum of all values, divided by the number of values: $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n}$\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nWhat is the mean? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='3' data-answer='[\"6.8\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the median? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='3' data-answer='[\"6.5\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the mode? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"6\"]'/>\n\n:::\n\nMeasures of variation\n\nNext we will look at a measure of variation (i.e., indicating the amount of spread in the observations).\n\nConsider the grades of 6 students: 2, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nCompute the variance and standard deviation by hand.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Remind me how</button>\n\nThe variance is the \"average squared distance between observations and the mean\": $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}{n-1}$\n\nThe SD is the square root of the variance\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the mean, e.g., $\\bar{X} = 5$\n2. For each observation, calculate the distance from the mean; e.g., $3-5 = -2$\n3. Square these distances, e.g.: $(-2)^2 = 4$\n4. Add these distances for all observations\n5. Divide by number of observations minus 1\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nWhat is the variance? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='3' data-answer='[\"5.9\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the standard deviation? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"2.43\"]'/>\n\n:::\n\nWe now will verify the answer to the question in the previous step using SPSS!\n\nFirst, we have to enter the data in SPSS. Proceed as follows:\n\nOpen SPSS (use Unicode, and close the opening windows)\n\nMake sure that you have the data view on the screen\n\nType in the grades in SPSS (i.e.: 2, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9):\n\nGo to variable view and change the name of the variable and provide a meaningful label\n\nSecond, we can compute the variance and standard deviation in SPSS.\n\nProceed as follows:\n\nAnalyze > Descriptive statistics > Descriptives\n\nSelect the variable you just defined\nNow click op Options. A new window opens which shows many more descriptive options\nEnable the variance\nClick Continue and OK\n\nConsult the table descriptive statistics in the output window.\n\nWere your computations correct?\n \n## Correlation\n\nFor the next few questions we need the data file `LAS_SocSc_DataLab2.sav`.\nOpen the file in SPSS. You will see that the file contains data for six variables, named X1 through X6. We will inspect the associations between pairs of variables (so called bivariate relationships).\n\nFirst, generate a scatter plot for X1 and X2. Proceed as follows: Graphs > Legacy dialogs > Scatter/dot. Then ask for a Simple scatter. Put X1 on the X-Axis and X2 on the Y-Axis. Describe the association. Take into account whether the relationship follows a straight line (i.e., linearity), is positive or negative (i.e., direction), and whether the relationship seems to be weak, moderate or strong (i.e., strength).\n\nSecond, generate a scatter plot for X3 and X4. Make sure that X3 is shown on the X-axis and X4 on the Y-axis. Describe the association in terms of linearity, direction and strength.\n\nThird, generate a scatter plot for X5 and X6. Describe the association in terms of linearity, direction and strength.\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nIs the relationship between X1-X2 positive? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nIs the relationship between X5-X6 positive? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nIs the relationship between X1-X2 linear? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nIs the relationship between X3-X4 linear? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nGive an indication of the strength of the relationship between X1-X2: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>zero</option><option value='answer'>moderate</option><option value=''>weak</option><option value=''>strong</option></select>\n\nGive an indication of the strength of the relationship between X3-X4: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>zero</option><option value=''>moderate</option><option value='answer'>strong</option><option value=''>weak</option></select>\n\nGive an indication of the strength of the relationship between X5-X6: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>zero</option><option value=''>weak</option><option value=''>strong</option><option value='answer'>moderate</option></select>\n\n:::\n\n\nConsider the relationship between X3 and X4, can you think of an example of two variables that would be associated in this way?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Show answer</button>\n\n\nAny cyclical process;\n\n* Time in the day and how far the water reaches up the beach (ebb and flow)\n* Location of the sun in the sky\n \n\n</div>\n\n\n### Correlation Coefficient\n\nIn this step we will look at the correlation coefficient as numerical description of linear association.\n\nNotice that in the previous step we found a non-linear association. The correlation coefficient would not be a valid measure to describe such an association, but nevertheless it is instructive to see why caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions about association from the correlation coefficient alone.\n\nWe will use SPSS to compute the correlation coefficient.\n\nAnalyze > Correlate > Bivariate\nSelect X1, X2, ... X6 as the variables\nClick OK\n\nConsult the table Correlations in the output.\n\nThere are several values in the table, but we are looking for the Pearson Correlation. The other numbers are the so called significance level, a concept we discuss soon, and the sample size.\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient for the variables X1 and X2? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='3' data-answer='[\"0.5\",\".5\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient for the variables X2 and X6? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"0.06\",\".06\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient for the variables X3 and X4? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"-0.8\",\"-.8\"]'/>\n\nCan we interpret this correlation coefficient? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>No, assumption of normality violated</option><option value=''>Yes, otherwise SPSS would give an error</option><option value=''>No, assumption of association violated</option><option value='answer'>No, assumption of linearity violated</option></select>\n\nInterpret the correlation between X5 and X6? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Weak positive</option><option value=''>Moderate positive</option><option value=''>Weak negative</option><option value='answer'>Moderate negative</option></select>\n\n:::\n",
