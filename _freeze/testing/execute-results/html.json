It involves formulating hypotheses, calculating test statistics, determining p-values, and drawing conclusions about the null hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis testing builds upon previously covered topics like sampling theory and estimation, where sample statistics are used as the best estimate of population parameters;\nstandard errors to express the uncertainty surrounding those estimates;\nand probability calculus, using probability distributions - like the standard normal distribution - to compute the probability of observing certain values based on the sampling distribution.\n\nTo introduce the concept of hypothesis testing, let's consider an intuitive example. Imagine your car won't start, and you hypothesize that the battery is dead. You then perform an experiment by replacing the battery. If the car starts, you conclude that your initial hypothesis was correct - the battery was indeed dead.\n\nIn this thought experiment, you only need one piece of evidence.\nStatistical hypothesis instead rely on evidence from many observations, and use probability calculus to test hypotheses in the presence of uncertainty.\nStatistical tests use probability calculations to compute how probable it is to observe the sample data if the null hypothesis were true.\nIf the resulting probability is very low, we may doubt whether the null hypothesis is indeed true.\n\nThe steps involved in hypothesis testing are as follows:\n\n1. Formulate hypotheses: This involves stating a testable proposition about population parameters.\n2. Calculate a test statistic: The test statistic describes how many standard errors away from the population statistic, under the null hypothesis, the sample statistic is.\n3. Calculate the p-value: The p-value represents the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the sample statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n4. Draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis: Based on the p-value, we either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nHypotheses can be formulated as equality or inequality statements. Equality hypotheses state that a value, difference, or effect is equal to zero, while inequality hypotheses state that a value, difference, or effect is larger or smaller than a specific value. It's important to keep in mind that hypothesis testing does not provide evidence for hypotheses but rather helps in casting doubt on a null hypothesis.\n\nIn addition to the null hypothesis, we can also specify an alternative hypothesis.\nThe specification of the alternative hypothesis depends on a bit of philosophy of science.\nFisher's philosophy suggests using only a null hypothesis; if this null hypothesis is rejected, the \"truth\" must be anything other than the null hypothesis.\nWe could thus say that, according to Fisher's philosophy, the alternative hypothesis is the negation of the null hypothesis. If $H_0: \\mu = 0$, then $H_a: \\mu \\neq 0$; or, if $H_0: \\mu > 0$, then $H_a: \\mu \\leq 0$. The alternative hypothesis is in both cases the \"opposite\" of the null hypothesis.\n\nNeyman-Pearson's philosophy instead involves stating specific null and alternative hypotheses, with an explicit expected effect size for the alternative hypothesis. Assuming a specific expected effect size allows us to calculate the probabilities of drawing correct or incorrect conclusions.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, we calculate a test statistic, which measures the distance between the hypothesized population value and the sample statistic in terms of standard errors.\nThe probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one we did observe is computed using an appropriate probability distribution.\nFor many tests, we use either the Z-distribution or t-distribution, depending on whether we know the population standard deviation or not.\nThis gives us a probability value (p-value), representing the probability of observing data as extreme as or more extreme than the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n\nWhen interpreting p-values, it's crucial to understand that they give the probability of observing certain data assuming the null hypothesis is true, rather than providing the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false. The p-value is then compared to a pre-determined significance level (usually denoted as alpha) to make a decision about accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nRejecting the null hypothesis indicates that the observed data is unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis were true. On the other hand, failing to reject the null hypothesis means that the observed data is not surprising or does not provide sufficient evidence to reject it.\n\nWhen testing hypotheses, we can make two types of errors: A Type I error refers to rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (a false-positive conclusion), while Type II error refers to accepting the null hypothesis when it is false (failing to detect a true effect).\n\n# Lecture\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1J2Ge0B3Ro >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n# Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

For two-tailed tests, if the observed effect is in the direction of the alternative hypothesis, you can half the two-tailed p-value.\n\n**Question 3**\n\nDivide the standard deviation by the square root of 45 to get the standard error. Then, divide the difference between the observed mean of 6 and the hypothesized mean of 5.5 by that standard error to get the test statistic. Then, find the critical t-values for a one-sided test with the three alpha levels mentioned in the answers in the t-distribution for 44 degrees of freedom (n - 1). Note that the answer is .05!\n\n**Question 4**\n\nInferential statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. It allows researchers to make educated guesses about population parameters based on the information collected from the sample. Calculating sample statistics is a step in the inferential process, but it is not the primary purpose of inferential statistics. Testing the null hypothesis is another inferential procedure, but it is a specific type of hypothesis testing, and not the overall purpose of inferential statistics.\n\n**Question 5**\n\nThe standard error is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the sample statistic as estimator of the population parameter. It represents how much the sample statistic is expected to vary from one sample to another if multiple samples were drawn from the same population.\n\n**Question 6**\n\nIn statistical testing, a hypothesis is a testable proposition about the population that can be examined using sample data. It is a statement or assumption that researchers put to the test to determine if there is evidence to support it or not. The hypothesis is formulated based on the theory or observations made about the population.\n\n**Question 7**\n\nPower in statistical testing refers to the probability of correctly detecting a true effect or relationship between variables. It is the likelihood of finding a significant result in a study when the effect being investigated truly exists in the population. It is important to have sufficient power in a study to avoid false-negative findings, where we fail to reject the null hypothesis when there is a real effect. Power is one minus the probability of committing a Type II error, or 1-beta.\n\n**Question 8**\n\nTo calculate the t-value for this hypothesis test, you can use the formula: t = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / square root of sample size). Plugging in the values, t = (68 - 65) / (2 / sqrt(50)) = 10.61.\n\n**Question 9**\n\nThe t-value for a two-tailed t-test can be calculated using the formula: t = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / square root of sample size). In this case, the population mean is 30 minutes. Plugging in the values, t = (28 - 30) / (3 / sqrt(25)) = -3.33.\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Tutorial\n\n## Assignment 1: Hypothesis Testing - Formulating Hypotheses\n\nDiscuss with your portfolio group the logic behind hypothesis testing, and how it relates to your personal (and group's) research interests.\n\nConsider the following three research descriptions. Formulate H0 and H1 in words. Discuss your answers with your group members.\n\nResearchers want to know whether it matters for test performance if an exam is completed on a computer or using paper and pencil.\nHence, the research question reads: Is there an effect of the type of administration (computer or paper and pencil) on the test performance?\n\nWhat would be the H0 and HA for this study?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Show answer</button>\n\nThis appears to be an undirected hypothesis about a mean difference for two independent samples, without a clearly specified alternative hypothesis. Thus, we could state:\n\n$H_0: \\mu_{computer} = \\mu_{paper}$\n$H_A: \\mu_{computer} \\neq \\mu_{paper}$\n\n</div>\n\n\nResearchers want to know whether the alcohol consumption among Dutch students differs from the alcohol consumption in the general Dutch population. Using CBS statistics, they know that in the general population the average alcohol consumption is 5.6 glasses a week. The question is whether the average alcohol consumption among students is different from this national average.\n\nWhat would be the H0 and H1 for this study?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Show answer</button>\n\nThis appears to be an undirected hypothesis about the difference between a mean and a hypothesized value, without a clearly specified alternative hypothesis.

We could thus state:\n\n$H_0: \\rho = 0$\n$H_A: \\rho \\neq 0$\n\n</div>\n\n\nFormulating the hypothesis is an important very first step in hypotheses testing. Continue with the next assignment, in which we will go through the steps of a hypothesis test.\n\n## Assignment 2: Test Statistics, Alpha and Significance\n\nIn this assignment we will go through the steps of a hypothesis test.\n\nWhile going through the steps we will come across the most important concepts related to hypothesis testing.\n\nFor the next steps, we consider the following situation:\n\nSuppose we are interested in the personality profile of musicians; that is, we want to know whether, on average, personality characteristics of musicians differ from those of the general population. For now, we'll only focus on Openness. We pretend that we have collected data among 25 musicians using a validated scale for which previous research has shown that in the general population the scores are normally distributed with mean 50 and SD 15. It is our task to test whether the mean of Openness for musicians differs from the mean in the general population. To keep things simple, we assume that in the population of musicians the SD is the same as in the general population; that is, we assume that LaTeX: $\\sigma = 15$. \n\n\nLet openness be the variable of interest. Let $\\mu_{musicians}$ represent the mean openness in the population of musicians. The hypothesis test amounts to testing:\n\n$H0: \\mu_{musicians} = 50$\n\n$H1: \\mu_{musicians} \\neq 50$\n\nNow, when we do the hypothesis test, we seek for evidence against the null hypothesis. More specifically, our testing procedure starts with the assumption that H0 represents the truth and as long as we don’t have convincing evidence that our assumption is false we stick to that assumption.\n\nThe question is, however, when do we have convincing evidence against H0?\n\nFinding evidence against H0 works as follows:\n\nIf H0 is true, we expect mean values close to H0.\nAnd, if we observe a mean value that is much different from the value under H0, we have convincing evidence against H0. If this happens, we reject H0 as representing the truth and accept the alternative hypothesis, H1.\n\nHypothesis testing fits Popper’s philosophy of falsification. He introduced this well-known analogy to explain the logic of falsificationism:\n\n1. Suppose we assume that all Swans are white, $H_0: Swans = white$\n2. We would then not expect to observe black ones.\n3. If we do observe black swans, our initial hypothesis is called into question.\n4. The number of white swans we see (= observations consistent with the hypothesis) does not provide evidence for $H_0$, because there could always be a black swan out there we haven't observed yet.\n\nSo, the next questions are: \n\nWhat are the sample values we can expect under H0?\nWhen is evidence \"convincing\" enough? \nTo answer the first question we have to go back to sampling distributions!\n\nFor the second question, we need a criterion. We have to realize that even if H0 is true, sample values can be far off just by sampling fluctuations (i.e., by chance). The common criterion is: if the observed value is among the 5% most unlikely samples under H0 (i.e. if H0 is true), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\nLet's go back to our example about musicians.\n\nLet X be openness. Under H0 we assume that X is normally distributed with mean 50 and SD equal to 15. \n\nWhat are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean under H0 given that the sample size is 25? And what do we call the standard deviation of the sampling distribution? \n\n(Use what you have learned in the previous lectures. Hint: first make a drawing of the situation, then do the computations).\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nSampling distribution:\n\n- Mean: $\\mu = 50$\n- Standard error ( =SD of sampling distribution!): $\\sigma_\\bar{X} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{25}}= 3$\n\n\n</div>\n\n \nSuppose we want to indicate sample means that are unlikely if H0 would be true. In particular, we want to know how far the sample mean must be from the hypothesized mean to be among the 5% of all possible samples under H0 that are furthest away from the hypothesized means.\n\nWhat should the value of the sample mean be to fall within the 5% most deviant samples if the sample size is 25?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nWe are talking about the distribution of the mean; so we need to work with the sampling distribution. We want to know the cut offs that mark the 2.5% highest and 2.5% lowest means. We first have to find the Z-values: they are 1.96 for the highest 2.5%, and (by symmetry) -1.96 marks the 2.5% lowest.\n\nHence, to be among the 5% of all possible sample means that are most unlikely under H0, the sample mean should be:\n\nlarger than 50+1.96 x 3 = 55.88\nor smaller than 50-1.96 x 3 = 44.12\n \n\n</div>\n\n\nLet's do some more exercises on the Z-test.\n \nSuppose the mean for Openness we found in our sample was 59.\n\nIf we use a significance level of 5%, would we reject the null hypothesis? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Yes</option><option value=''>No</option></select>\n\nIn the previous step we used cut offs for the sample means to decide about significance. The cut off scores were obtained via the Z-distribution. However, doing all these computations is not necessary (there's a shortcut!!). In fact, if we know the Z-value for the sample, we can easily find out if the sample is among the 5% of the most unlikely sample means. We only have to compare the value with 1.96 and -1.96 to see whether that is the case.\n\nIn this course, we will use Z-values for different purposes. In these specific calculations, Z is used as a *Test Statistic*. A test statistic quantifies evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, the Z test statistic expresses how far away from the mean under the null hypothesis the observed mean is, in terms of the number of standard errors.\n\nThe Z test-statistic follows the standard normal distribution. The values 1.96 and -1.96 are called the critical values and they mark the 5% most unlikely sample means under H0. In other words, the critical values mark the reject region for H0. \n\nSo, if we compute the Z-value for the sample mean, and if that sample value of Z falls in the rejection region, we reject H0 (we found something that is unlikely enough to no longer believe H0 is true). If H0 is rejected we speak of a significant result. See the graph below:\n\n![](images/LAS_3_2_Graph-1-1.jpg)\n \nFollowing these steps to test a mean is one example of performing a *\"Z-test\"*!\n\nWe can use the Z-test to test hypotheses about the population mean if we know the population $\\sigma$.\n\nThe test statistic for the Z-test is:\n\n$z  = \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma_\\bar{X}}$\n\n\nThis statistic is computed using the mean from the sample, the hypothesized mean under H0 and $\\sigma$.\n\nH0 is rejected at the 5% significance level if z is either larger than 1.96 or smaller than -1.96.\n\nSo far, we rejected the null hypothesis if the sample is among the 5% most unlikely sample means under H0. This 5% was called the significance level, and is denoted as $\\alpha = .05$. However, we could just as well choose 1% or .5%.\n\nWhat would be the critical values for the Z-test if one tests at $\\alpha = .01$? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"2.58\"]'/>\n\nWhat would be the critical values for the Z-test if one tests at $\\alpha = .005\\%$? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"2.81\"]'/>\n\nFor historical reasons, social scientists tend to use $\\alpha = 0.05$ as a default. So in this course, if alpha is not explicitly stated, assume $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n\nWhen we test hypotheses we reject H0 if the sample we find is unlikely if H0 is true. However, the flip side is that, even though H0 is true, we may find a sample that is much different by chance, and erroneously reject H0. Or, in other words, we could make an error. Rejecting H0 while it is true in reality is called a Type I error!\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. If H0 is true, and you test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, what is the probability of committing a Type I error?\n2. What is the link between the $\\alpha$-level and type I error rate?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\n1. If H0 is really true (i.e., H0 should not be rejected), then the probability that the sample mean is among the 5% most unlikely is equal to 5%. \n\n2. The alpha level specifies the risk of a Type I error. So if one tests at an alpha level of .05, it means that one accepts a risk of 5% to commit a Type I error. \n\n</div>\n\n \n\nProperties of the Z-test:\n\nUsed to test hypotheses about the mean in a population, assuming $\\sigma$ known.\n\nThe test-statistic equals $z = \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}$\n\nThe test statistic is normally distributed.\n\n## Assignment 3: Z-test\n\nIn this assignment we will apply the Z-test.\n\nThis assignment first presents an example, followed by two practice questions.\n\nA researcher wants to test $H_0: \\mu = 50$ against $H_1: \\mu \\neq 50$\n\nData are available from a random sample of 26 respondents.

In particular, we will look at significance levels.\n \nTo test hypotheses, we need to specify the \"significance level\", usually denoted by $\\alpha$. The significance level is our *decision criterion* to reject H0.\n\nThe most common choice is .05. But what does this criterion exactly entail?\n\n\nDiscuss with your group what an $\\alpha$ level entails.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nIf we test at an $\\alpha$ of .05 it means that we are willing to reject H0 in favor of H1 if our sample mean belongs to the 5% most extreme scores (2.5% in each tail) under the null hypothesis.\n\nIf indeed the sample mean is among this 5%, it means that we have observed a sample in a range that is quite unlikely if the null hypothesis would be true and, therefore, justifies rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\n</div>\n\n \n\nIn the previous assignments you already used the critical values for the Z-test for specific alpha levels.\n\nFor two-tailed tests, it holds that if the absolute value of Z exceeds the critical value, we may reject $H_0$.\n\nLet $Z_\\text{crit}$ be the critical value. For the Z-test it holds that:\n\n* $Z_\\text{crit} = 1.65$, if $\\alpha = 0.10$ (two-tailed)\n* $Z_\\text{crit} = 1.96$, if $\\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed)\n* $Z_\\text{crit} = 2.58$, if $\\alpha = 0.01$ (two-tailed)\n\n## Quiz\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\nResearchers want to test whether $\\mu=70$.

Researchers want to know if the average confidence level is different for those who have been a victim of crime. They collect data for 60 victims. They find a sample mean of 511. They test $H_0: \\mu = 500$ against $H_1: \\mu \\neq 500$, while assuming that the population variance is $\\sigma = 50$.\n\nCompute the p-value. Draw a graph for the two-tailed p-value. Write down in your own words and as precise as possible the interpretation of the p-value in the answer box below. Then, discuss your response with your group.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\n\n- The p-value represents the proportion of all possible sample means that are further away from our hypothesized mean than the observed sample mean is. \n- We have the sampling distribution with $\\mu = 500$ and $\\sigma_\\bar{X} = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{60}} = 6.455$.\n- First, we compute the right-tail area: $P(\\bar{X} > 511) = P(Z > 1.70) = 0.0446$.\n- Hence, 4.66% of all possible samples is further away from $H_0$ on the right side. \n- Second, we compute the left-tail area. These are the sample means that are more than 11 points from the hypothesized mean to the left $P(\\bar{X} < 489) = P(Z < -1.70) = 0.0446$. \n- Hence, the two-tailed p-value is 0.0892.\n\n</div>\n\n\nIs the test significant at the 5% level? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nIs it significant at the 1% level? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\nResearchers test whether $\\mu = 90$.
