We've also delved into the concept of interaction between binary and continuous predictors. In this chapter, we build upon that prior knowledge when explaining the Factorial ANOVA.\n\nFactorial ANOVA is used to examine the effects of multiple categorical predictors and their interactions on a continuous outcome variable. \nDespite its historical development as a separate method, factorial ANOVA can be conceptualized as a special case of multiple regression. It combines the concepts of dummy coding and interaction that we've previously encountered. Each factor is represented via dummy coding, and creating interaction terms are computed by multiplying those dummies.\n\nThe reason ANOVA is often considered a separate technique is that it has different historical roots from regression, and because of those roots, researchers typically focus on different output when reporting factorial ANOVA versus regression. For example, ANOVA focuses more on variance explained by each factor, and overall tests of the effect of each Factor across all of its levels.\n\nA factorial ANOVA involves two or more factors, each with multiple levels. Each combination of factor levels creates a unique condition or group in the study. For instance, if we have Factor A with 3 levels and Factor B with 2 levels, the factorial design will have a total of 3 × 2 = 6 groups.\n\nFactorial designs can be visually represented in a matrix-like structure, where each cell represents a unique combination of factor levels. This representation helps us understand the experimental conditions and the interactions between factors.\n\nIn factorial ANOVA, we examine main effects and interaction effects. As in multiple regression, main effects represent the influence of each factor on the dependent variable, controlling for all other predictors. Interaction effects capture how the effects of one factor depend on the levels of another factor. \n\nBecause each factor may be represented by multiple dummies, we can't use individual t-tests for the dummies to determine the siginficance of the Factor they belong to. Instead, we use F-tests to test the significance of the effect of a Factor. These F-tests compare the variance explained by the factor to the unexplained variance.\n\nIn addition to significance tests, effect size measures help us understand the practical importance of the effects observed in factorial ANOVA. Eta squared and partial eta squared are common effect size measures that quantify the proportion of variance explained by each factor or interaction, relative to the total variance or unexplained variance, respectively.\nEta squared is just a different name for R squared; partial eta squared is something different, and typically only reported for ANOVA.\n\n# Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBQoxrleFoM >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material. If you get a question wrong, you will receive a hint on how to improve your understanding of the material.\n\nComplete the formative test ideally after you’ve seen the lecture, but before the lecture meeting in which we can discuss any topics that need more attention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n**Question 1**\n\nWhat is the primary objective of factorial ANOVA?

It specifies exactly the same model as we have been investigating, but its output is more focused on information that is typically requested when estimating a model with only categorical predictors and (optionally) interactions between them.\n\nWe will now use the ANOVA interface and pay special attention to output it gives us that is not directly available via the Regression interface.\n\nYou can either use the graphical user interface, or copy-paste this syntax. Either way, pay particular attention to the following:\n\n* Under Options, ask for Homogeneity tests: `/PRINT=HOMOGENEITY`\n* Under Options, ask for Estimates of effect size: `/PRINT=ETASQ`\n* Under Options, ask for Parameter Estimates: `/PRINT=PARAMETER`\n* Under EM Means (expected marginal means), ask for the means for the interaction, and compare Main effects: `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`\n\n\n```\nUNIANOVA Tip BY Behavior Gender\n  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)\n  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE\n  /PLOT=PROFILE(Behavior*Gender)\n  /PRINT=ETASQ HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE PARAMETER\n  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Gender) ADJ(LSD)\n  /DESIGN=Behavior Gender Behavior*Gender.\n```\n\nCopy and run this syntax.\n\nNote that the table labelled **Parameter Estimates** is identical to the Coefficients table from the previous regression analysis.\n\nAlso note that, for example, the F-value for the explained variance for the interaction between Gender an Behavior is identical to the F-value for the $\\Delta R^2$ test you performed in the previous hierarchical regression analysis.\n\n### Homoscedasticity\n\nRegression models have an assumption of homoscedasticity. If all predictors are categorical, that means that we assume equal variances in all groups.\n\nThe ANOVA output offers us a Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Find it, and answer the following question:\n\nTrue or false: There is reason to doubt the assumption of homogeneity. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nWhat is the value of the appropriate test statistic? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"1.644\"]'/>\n\n\nTrue or false: As a rule, the assumption of homogeneity is more likely to be violated in a factorial ANOVA with an unbalanced design (as compared to a balanced design). <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\n### Effect size\n\nWe can also calculate effect sizes $\\eta^2$ or partial $\\eta^2$, for the two factors and the interaction effect separately.\n\nRecall that $\\eta^2$ is just the explained variance, $R^2$. In other words: What proportion of the total sum of squares is explained by the factor of interest?\n\nWe obtain $\\eta^2$ for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, $SS_A$, by the $SST$, which is labeled \"Corrected total\" in the ANOVA output: $\\eta^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SST}$\n\nWhat is $\\eta^2$ for the interaction effect? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"0.23\",\".23\"]'/>\n  \nGo back to your previous nested model test, where you determined whether adding the interaction terms led to a significant improvement in explained variance, $\\Delta R^2$. Verify that this number is identical to the $\\eta^2$ for the interaction! They are the same thing.\n\n\nAnother measure of effect size is the partial $\\eta^2$. It tells us what proportion of the variance not explained by other factors is explained by the factor of interest.\n\nWe obtain $\\eta_p^2$ for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, $SS_A$, by $SS_A$ plus the residual sum of squares $SSE$: $\\eta_p^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SS_A+SSE}$.\n\nNote that SPSS allows us to request partial $\\eta^2$. We did so by including the line `/PRINT=ETASQ` in our syntax.\n\nWhat is the value of partial $\\eta^2$ for the factor Behavior? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.515\",\".515\"]'/>\n\n\n### Pairwise comparisons\n\nAnother unique feature of the ANOVA interface is that it gives us all pairwise comparisons when we ask for them using the code `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`\n\nNote that this line asks for comparisons of the three levels of behavior for each gender separately. You can also ask for comparisons of the two levels of gender for each behavior separately by specifying `COMPARE(Gender)` instead.\n\nInspect the table Pairwise Comparisons. The three experimental conditions are compared in a pairwise manner, split over the factor Gender.\n\nFor which pair of groups do the means differ significantly from one another (at the 5% level)? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Waiter: Neutral-Smiley</option><option value=''>Waiter: Small talk-Smiley</option><option value='answer'>Waitress: Neutral-Smiley</option><option value=''>Waiter: Neutral-Small talk</option></select> \n \nLook at the note under the table. True or false: the p-values in this table are adjusted for multiple comparisons. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nWhy do we need to apply a correction like the Bonferroni correction?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nWhen doing multiple tests on one sample, like doing these pairwise comparisons, the level of risk of a Type I error increases. To correct for this, we should use an adjusted alpha-level, such as the Bonferroni correction.\n\nAlthough it is possible to ask for SPSS to adjust the p-values in the table, I have expressly not instructed you to do so. The reason for this is that, strictly speaking, Bonferroni is an adjustment of the significance level $\\alpha$ - not of the p-values. Moreover, sometimes you conduct many more tests in a study aside from the pairwise comparisons performed here. In that case, you might want to include those in your Bonferroni correction too, and SPSS does not know about their existence when it applies a Bonferroni correction to the p-values.\n\nIn other words: It is better to set the alpha level yourself, and apply it consistently across all tests in a study.\n\n</div>\n\n\n### Simple Effects test\n\nThe significant interaction effect tells us that the effect of behavior differs by gender, or conversely, that gender differences vary across the three behavoirs.\n\nSimple effects analysis allows us to test the significance of these marginal effects.\n\nSimply put: They give us an overall test of the mean differences across levels of one factor, within each level of a different factor.\n\nConsult the table Univariate Tests (still for the contrast `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`). This table displays the results of the simple effects tests.\n\nDoes the Behavior of waiters have an influence on the amount of tip money people give?\n\nWhat is the appropriate p-value? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.557\",\".557\"]'/>\n\nReport the simple effect test for waiters and interpret the finding, then check your answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nThere is no significant difference among the three behaviors within waiters. Hence, for waiters we don’t have evidence that the behavior has an effect on average tips received, F(2,52) = 0.591, p = .557.\n \n\n</div>\n\n\nAgain, consult the table Univariate Tests. This table gives the results of the simple effects tests.\n\nWhat p-value do we see here? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.001\",\".001\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: the type of behavior of waitresses has an influence on the tip people give. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\nDoes it make sense to adjust your behavior as a waiter/waitress if you want to increase your tip?\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_HPUGREWGGV'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HPUGREWGGV\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>For waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waiters it does not.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HPUGREWGGV\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For both waiters and waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HPUGREWGGV\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For both waiters and waitresses behavior does not affect amount of tip money received.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HPUGREWGGV\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For waiters behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waitresses it does not.</span></label></div>\n \n\n\nReport your results, then check the answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nWe do see a significant effect of behavior on average tip money for waitresses, F(2,52) = 46.385, p < .001. Hence, we have convincing evidence that the type of behavior by waitresses affects the average amount of tips. Results suggest that in order to have high tips, waitresses best can make small talk.\n \n\n</div>\n\n\n \n\n## Optional: do it yourself!\n\nOpen the datafile [`hiking.sav`](data/hiking.sav). The data file also contains data on weather.\n\nExamine the effect of weather and behavior and their potential interaction, with feelings as the dependent variable. \n\n\nWhat is the explained variance of the main effects and interaction effects together? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.239\",\".239\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: the explained variance of the whole model is significant. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nTrue or false: the interaction effect is significant. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nRequest a plot from SPSS that allows you to describe what the effects look like.\n\nDescribe the trends in your own words, then check your answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nThe lines in the plot are not parallel, also pointing to an interaction effect.\n\n\n\n</div>\n \n\n\nPerform a simple effects analysis of the effect of behavior by weather.\n \nReport your findings and conclusion, then check your answer.\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nWe see a significant effect of behavior when the weather was good, F(4,90) = 3.864, p = .006, while the effect of behavior is not significant when the weather was bad, F(4,90) = 1.320, p = .269.\n\nResults suggest that when the weather is good, joking and singing significantly improves the participants’ feelings about the guide.\n\nWhen the weather is bad, the behavior of the guide does not have much influence.\n\n\n</div>\n \n \n",
