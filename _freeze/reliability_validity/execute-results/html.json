Crucially, oftentimes the same construct is measured with multiple questions. Researchers may want to know whether these questions do a good job at measuring the construct of interest. This is the topic we will explore this week.\n\nRecall that a construct is an abstract feature of interest within a population, such as intelligence, perseverance, or education. Some constructs can be either observed (directly measured); other constructs are latent (measured indirectly through observed indicators, which can be questions).\n\nExamples of observed constructs are height and weight. Latent constructs cannot be directly measured and require observed indicators to capture their underlying meaning. Latent constructs are commonly used in social sciences to measure attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and other complex attributes. The items, more often than not, are questions in a questionnaire - although they could also be tests, performance assessments, behavioral observations, multiple choice questions, puzzles, et cetera.\n\n### Classical Test Theory\n\nClassical Test Theory posits that observed test scores are a function of the true score on the latent construct, plus measurement error. Different sources of measurement error can influence observed scores, including instrument properties and individual factors.\n\n### Reliability\n\nReliability refers to the consistency or stability of test scores over time or across different measurement occasions. It is related to the proportion of true score variance to total score variance. Reliability can be estimated using methods such as test-retest reliability (consistency across repeated measurements), internal consistency (consistency across items within a test), and inter-rater reliability (consistency across different raters).\n\n#### Test-Retest Reliability\n\nTest-retest reliability involves administering the same test to the same participants on two separate occasions and calculating the correlation between their scores. Test-retest reliability is suitable for stable traits and can provide insight into the stability of a construct over time. However, learning effects, memory effects, and change over time need to be considered when determining the appropriate interval between test administrations.\n\n#### Internal Consistency\n\nInternal consistency measures the association among items within a test. It can be estimated using methods such as split halves or Cronbach's alpha. Split halves involve dividing the test into two halves and correlating the scores between them. Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency that indicates how closely related items are to each other within a scale. It is affected by the number of items, their average covariance, and their average variance. Note that this means you can artificially inflate Cronbach's alpha by using very similar items, or using very many items.\n\nWhen diagnosing the internal consisteny of a scale, we can compute item-total correlations to examine the correlation between individual items and the total scale score (minus that item). Low item-total correlations may indicate problematic items, and Cronbach's alpha can be recalculated with items removed to assess their impact on reliability.\n\n### Validity\n\nValidity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. There are several types of validity, including face validity (whether the items appear relevant to the construct), content validity (whether the instrument adequately covers all aspects of the construct), and criterion validity (whether the instrument is associated with relevant outcomes or indicators of the construct).\n\n#### Face Validity\n\nFace validity assesses whether items in an instrument are clearly related to the construct of interest. It considers the clarity, readability, and unambiguity of wording and answer options. Face validity is subjective and relies on a first-glance assessment of whether the items seem relevant to the construct being measured.\n\n#### Content Validity\n\nContent validity is usually determined by involving experts in the field, and having them define the construct's scope, generating items for subdomains of the construct, and rating the relevance of items. An instrument has content validity if it adequately covers all aspects of the construct. Content validity is essential for ensuring that the instrument comprehensively captures the intended construct.\n\n#### Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity assesses whether an instrument is associated with outcomes or indicators of the construct it is designed to measure. This can involve correlations between the instrument and external measures (e.g., other validated scales) or predictions of behavior related to the construct. Criterion validity provides evidence that the instrument measures what it is intended to measure.\n\nIn sum, effective measurement instruments in the social sciences must have both high reliability and high validity. Reliability ensures that the instrument consistently measures the same construct with low measurement error, and validity ensures that the instrument accurately measures the intended construct (not something else). By considering these principles, researchers can enhance the quality and meaningfulness of their questionnaire-based measurements.\n\n## Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuxXUQCI_XI >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

You should not follow this blindly, but you can use it to identify items that don't work well with the rest of the scale. This says nothing about the reliability of individual items, nor their validity. \n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Norm Violating Behaviors\n\nIn this assignment we are going to take a look at scale that measures whether people engage in norm violating behaviors.\n\nThe scale consists of the following items:\n\n* Joyriding\n* Taking soft drugs\n* Accepting a bribe\n* Throwing away litter\n* Driving under influence of alcohol\n* Smoking in public places\n* Speeding over limit\n* Euthanasia\n\nOpen the datafile [`evs.sav`](data/evs.sav).\n\n \n\nIn SPSS, navigate to Analyze --> Scale --> Reliability Analysis.\n\nSelect the seven items that are in this scale.\n\nThen go to statistics and select the options “Item”, “Scale” and “Scale if item deleted”.

The data file contains data on Machiavellianism and some other variables.\n\n \n\nThe included Machiavellianism scale consists of the following 20 items. These items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale ranging from \"Disagree\" to \"Agree\".\n\nQ1. Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so.\n\nQ2. The best way to handle people is to tell them what they want to hear.\n\nQ3. One should take action only when sure it is morally right.\n\nQ4. Most people are basically good and kind.\n\nQ5. It is safest to assume that all people have a vicious streak, and it will come out when they are given a chance.\n\nQ6. Honesty is the best policy in all cases.\n\nQ7. There is no excuse for lying to someone else.\n\nQ8. Generally speaking, people won't work hard unless they're forced to do so.\n\nQ9. All in all, it is better to be humble and honest than to be important and dishonest.\n\nQ10. When you ask someone to do something for you, it is best to give the real reasons for wanting it rather than giving reasons which carry more weight.\n\nQ11. Most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives.\n\nQ12. Anyone who completely trusts anyone else is asking for trouble.\n\nQ13. The biggest difference between most criminals and other people is that the criminals are stupid enough to get caught.\n\nQ14. Most people are brave.\n\nQ15. It is wise to flatter important people.\n\nQ16. It is possible to be good in all respects.\n\nQ17. P.T. Barnum was wrong when he said that there's a sucker born every minute.\n\nQ18. It is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there.\n\nQ19. People suffering from incurable diseases should have the choice of being put painlessly to death.\n\nQ20. Most people forget more easily the death of their parents than the loss of their property.\n\n \n\nItems can be indicative or contra-indicative of a certain trait.\n\nWhich items are contra-indicative to the trait Machiavellianism?\n\n \n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nIn this assignment, the following questions are contra-indicative:\nQ3, Q4, Q6, Q7, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q14, Q16, and Q17.\n\nIf an item is contra indicative, low scores on these items indicate a lot of Machiavellianist traits, whereas high scores indicate not so much of an endorsement of Machiavellianist traits in one’s personality.\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe need to recode contraindicative items before we carry out reliability analysis.\n\nHowever, just to see what happens, let’s first carry out a reliability analysis with all original (i.e. not recoded) variables.\n\nTake the following steps:\n\nAnalyze --> Scale --> Reliability Analysis\n\nSelect the 20 items (Q1A - Q20A)\n\nClick on Statistics\n\nUnder Descriptives, select Items, Scale, and Scale if item deleted\n\nUnder Inter-Item, select Correlations\n\nPaste and run the syntax\n \nWhat is the estimated reliability? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.233\",\".233\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: This scale can be considered reliable. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nThis low reliability might be a result of the fact that we have not recoded our contra-indicative items yet. We can also see this in the inter-item correlation table; many of the items are negatively correlated! Let’s rectify this.\n\nWe have to recode all contraindicative items. Use syntax to do so, and check your answer below.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\n```\nCOMPUTE Q3r = 6-Q3A.\nEXECUTE.\n```\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n \nFor the second person in the dataset, the original score on Q4A was <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"4\"]'/> and the score on the recoded variable Q4r was <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"2\"]'/>.\n\nBased on this comparison, do you think you successfully recoded the variable?\n\n\nWe will now run the reliability analysis including the recoded items. Chnge your syntax, or re-run the analysis via the visual interface.\n\nWhat is the value of Cronbach’s Alpha? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.887\",\".887\"]'/>\n\nThis Cronbach’s Alpha is <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Poor</option><option value=''>Adequate</option><option value='answer'>Good</option><option value=''>Questionable</option></select> \n\n\n Check the corrected item total correlations.\n\nWhich of these items has the smallest association with other items in the scale? (Type its name) <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='3' data-answer='[\"Q19\"]'/>\n \nExplain why you think it makes sense (or not) that this item is correlated the least with the rest of the scale.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nThis item-total correlation of Q19 is .255.\n\nItem Q19 reads: “People suffering from incurable diseases should have the choice of being put painlessly to death”.\n\nOne could argue that a high score on this item should relate to a low score on the scale for agreeing with this item nowadays might actually show empathy with those suffering.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nInspect Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted. If you had to remove one item based on this Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted, which item would it be? (Type its original name) <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='3' data-answer='[\"Q17\"]'/>\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\n\nBased on the Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted, we would delete the item that would result in the greatest increase in Cronbach’s Alpha if it would be deleted.\n\nWe find the highest Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted for the item Q17r (.889).\n\nTherefore, based on the Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted, we would delete item Q17r.\n\n\n</div>\n\n \n\nTaking everything into consideration, would you remove any items from the Machiavellianism scale?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\n\nTaking the statistical output into consideration, we might want to consider removing item Q17r or item Q19.\n\nWe do so for two reasons:\n\n1. They both correlate less than .3 with the other items on the scale, and\n2. have a Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted higher than .887 (the current Cronbach’s Alpha of the scale).\n\nPlease note that we should always take into consideration theoretical reasons as well when deciding to delete an item from a scale. In this assignment, however, we base our conclusions on statistical reasons only.\n\n \n\nYou might want to consider removing item Q17 or Q19. They both correlate less than .3 with the rest of the scale, and have an Alpha if item removed higher than .887.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe always remove items one by one. We start with the worst item. After removing a bad item from a scale, the item-statistics will change a little. It might be that the item-statistics improve, and that there is no need to remove the second item.\n\nHowever, since the differences are not that big and the scale reliability is pretty high, we will keep both items in our scale for the remainder of this assignment.\n\n\nOnce we finished reliability analysis, we can use the scale in other analyses.\n\nIn order to do that, we need to arrive at a total scale score. So, we need one score for each person in the dataset that tells what their score is on the personality trait Machiavellianism.\n\nThere are several methods of obtaining such a total score, but one straightforward and easy way is to calculate the sum score.\n\nNavigate to Transform -> Compute Variable.\n\nGive a new name to the sum score in the box Target Variable, such as Mach.\n\nIn the box Numeric Expression, enter all variables and add together (i.e., Q1A + Q2A + Q3r …. + Q20A). Ensure that you use the recoded variables for the contra-indicative items!\n\nPaste and run the syntax.\n \n\nWe will now use our newly developed scale in a regression analysis! In this analysis we will try to explain Machiavellianism based on the variables Gender (0=men; 1=women), Age and Voted (0=Voted in past election, 1= Not voted in past election).\n\nNavigate to Analyze --> Regression --> Linear\n\nEnter the sumscore Mach as dependent variable\n\nEnter Gender, Age, and Voted as independent variables\n\nPaste and run the syntax\n\nInspect the Model Summary table. How much of the variance in Machiavellianism do the variables Gender, Age and Voted explain? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.126\",\".126\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: Gender, Age and Voting together explain a significant amount of variance in the variable Machiavellianism. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value='NA'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\nInspect the table Coefficients and take a look at the partial effects. Which of the variables does not have a significant partial effect on Machiavellianism? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Gender</option><option value=''>Age</option><option value='answer'>Voting</option></select> \n\n\nControlled for Age and Voting, which group (men or women) scores higher on the Machiavellianism scale? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Men</option><option value=''>Women</option></select> \n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nGiven that in the variable Gender men are coded as 0 and women are coded as 1, and that the regressions coefficient for Gender is negative (-7.440), we should conclude that men score higher on Machiavellianism than women, controlled for Age and Voting.\n \n\n</div>\n\n\nFinish the following sentence.\n\nControlled for Gender and Voting, if we would increase one year in age, the predicted score on the Machiavellianism scale would <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Increase with 0.243 units.</option><option value=''>Decrease with 0.243 units.</option><option value='answer'>Decrease with 0.294 units.</option><option value=''>Increase with 0.294 units.</option></select> \n  \n  \n### Solidarity\n\nIn this assignment, you will evaluate the reliability of a scale measuring solidarity.\n\nDownload and open the following data file: [`solidarity.sav`](data/solidarity.sav).\n\n \n\nYou’ve practiced with reliability analysis in the previous assignments. Now you can use that knowledge to evaluate the reliability of the solidarity scale more independently.\n\nInclude all eleven items that are part of the scale (v266 to v276). \n\n\n\nInspect the output of the reliability analysis.\n\nTrue or false: You have to recode questions. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='NA'>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nWe check if we should recode any items by looking at how they are phrased. To do so, we don’t necessarily need to look at the output.\n\nWe could, however, also use the inter-item correlations displayed in the output to check if we should recode items. If any of the inter-item correlations are negative, this should be in indication for contra-indicative items.\n\n\n</div>\n\n \n\nWhat is the reliability of the scale? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.847\",\".847\"]'/>\n\n\n\nIf you had to remove one item from the scale based on Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted, which one would you pick?

This is a theoretical reason for excluding item Q80E from the scale.\n\n</div>\n\n \n\nWhich item is most typical for the scale? Type its name: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='4' data-answer='[\"Q79D\"]'/>\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\n\nWe can tell from the higher item-total correlation, that tells us that this item has the strongest correlation with all other variables on the scale.\n\nAlso, the reliability of the scale would decrease most if this item would be deleted from the scale.\n\n\n</div>\n \n\nLast, construct sum scores on the scale for all individuals (via Transform -> Compute). Make sure you do not include the one item we discussed previously!\n\nOnce you created the sum score, have SPSS show the mean for this total score.\n\nWhat is the mean value of the sum score? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='6' data-answer='[\"27.897\"]'/>\n",
