The smaller or constrained model model is said to be \"nested in\" the larger or unconstrained model, meaning that all predictors in the smaller model are also present in the larger model. By definition, the unconstrained model always provides a better fit than the constrained model.\n\nIncremental F-tests are used to determine whether the increase in $R^2$ between two nested models is statistically significant. Recall that $R^2$ represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the predictors in the model. The incremental F-test compares the variation in the dependent variable explained by an unconstrained model with the variation explained by a constrained model. The F-test assesses whether the increase in R-squared is greater than what would be expected by chance alone, indicating the significance of adding additional predictors to the model.\n\nHierarchical regression refers to an approach where predictors are added to a regression model in blocks, allowing us to assess the additional variance explained by each block of predictors with an incremental F-test. Each block represents a set of predictors, and they are added to the model in a stepwise manner. This approach is useful when we want to determine the significance of adding a single categorical predictor which is represented by multiple dummy variables, or when we want to test whether adding some predictors (e.g., theoretically relevant variables) explain significant variance above and beyond other variables (e.g., demographic covariates). By conducting incremental F-tests at each step, we can assess the significance of adding each block of predictors and their contribution to the overall model.\n\nIn summary, nested models allow us to compare models with different levels of complexity, incremental F-tests help us determine the significance of adding predictors to a model, and hierarchical regression enables the examination of additional variance explained by different blocks of predictors. These concepts are valuable tools in statistical analysis and can provide insights into the relationships between variables and the predictive power of a model.\n\n## Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/s15b3KvfnO4 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

Which error type could the researchers have made? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Type I error </option><option value=''>Type II error</option><option value=''>Type I or Type II error </option></select>\n \n#### Examining Income\n\nIn the previous steps, we used the independent sample’s t-test to test for mean differences in public participation and found a significant result. Results suggested that males show higher levels of public participation. However, males and females may differ not only in gender, but also in other characteristics that explain differences in public participation. In particular, the researchers hypothesize that income differences may play a role as well. Research has shown that income is positively associated with public participation. So if males and females differ in income (on average), the gender differences in public participation may be partly due to income differences.\n\nIn other words, according to the researchers income may be a <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>confounder</option><option value=''>moderator</option><option value=''>predictor</option><option value=''>collider</option></select> of the effect of gender.\n\nBefore we proceed, let’s first check whether the groups differ on income. Request the means for the variable income for both males and females separately.\n\nDo the males and females in the sample differ in average income?\n\nTake your existing syntax for gender differences in Participation, and change it to test for income differences instead:\n\n```\nT-TEST GROUPS=Gender(0 1)\n  /MISSING=ANALYSIS\n  /VARIABLES=Income\n  /ES DISPLAY(TRUE)\n  /CRITERIA=CI(.95).\n```\n\nIs there a difference in income? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Yes</option><option value=''>No</option></select>\n\nThe next step is to study gender differences controlled for income differences. This is not possible via the independent samples t-test interface, but it is possible when specifying our model using regression analyses. Regression analysis allows us to study gender differences controlling for other variables.\n\n\n\n#### Add continuous predictor\n\nBefore we proceed with the regression analysis including income (we will do this in the next assignment), we will first see what the regression model looks like if we would only use gender as the only predictor in the model.\n\nRun a regression analysis using Public Participation as the dependent variable, and gender as the independent variable (Analyze > regression > linear). Note that the variable gender is already dummy coded.\n\nInspect the table with Coefficients.\n\n \nWhat is the regression slope of gender? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"6.502\"]'/>\n\nCompare the value to the mean difference from ; what do you see?\n\nRecall that the independent samples t-test is the exact same test as the t-test for the regression slope of a dummy variable.\n\nCompare the value of the t-statistic in the regression with the value of t-statistic in the independent samples t-test (you may ignore the minus signs). What do you see?\n\nThe regression coefficient of gender is 6.502. This is the same as the difference in means of Public Participation between males and females.\nThe t-statistic of the regression coefficient is 4.942. The t-statistic in the independent samples t-test was -4.942. As we can ignore the minus sign (just make sure to check which group is higher than the other), we can conclude they are equal.\n \nWhat percentage of the total variance in public participation is explained by gender? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"37.3\"]'/>\n \nRecall that the independent samples t-test and regression analysis with a dummy variable predictor are completely equivalent; SPSS just offers different interfaces to the same linear model.\n\nWe need to use the regression interface when we want to add other predictors (e.g., income) to see if the gender differences are confounded by other characteristics, and we can calculate the R2 value to evaluate the size of the effect of gender.\n\n\nNext, we want to know whether there are differences in public participation between men and women with the same income level.\n\nIn other words: let's look at gender differences in public participation controlled for income.\n\nRun a regression analysis of public participation on income and gender (analyze -> regression -> linear). Consult the output and answer the following questions:\n\n\nGender and income jointly explain  <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"57.3\"]'/>% of the variance in public participation.\n \nWhich of the following alternatives correctly report the F-statistic testing the significance of the R2? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>F(2,40)=26.845, p < 0.001</option><option value=''>F(2,42)=26.845, p < 0.001</option></select> \n \nThe researchers conclude:\n\n“On average, women score 4.818 points higher on public participation than men.”\n\n\nIs this a valid conclusion? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>No</option><option value=''>Yes</option></select>\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nI hope you concluded that the researchers' conclusion is incorrect.\n\nThey should have said:\n\n“On average, women score 4.818 points less on public participation than men of an equal income level”\n\nSo, if we take two groups of men and women with the same income (= \"controlling for income\"), then we expect a mean difference of 4.818 in public participation.\n\n\n</div>\n\n \nIs there evidence of gender differences, while controlling for income differences when testing at $\\alpha = .01$? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Yes</option><option value=''>No</option></select>\n\nWrite down the complete regression equation, then check your answer below.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nThe regression equation is as follows:\n\n$\\text{Participation}_i = 5.762 + 3.475*\\text{Income}_i+ 4.818 * \\text{Gender}_i+e_i$\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nSuppose we have a man with an income of 3.0 and a woman with an income of 2.0, what is the predicted difference in public participation? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"8.293\"]'/>\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explanation</button>\n\nMan with an income of 3 has a predicted score of:\n\nPublic Participation′=5.762+3.475∗3+4.818 ∗1\n\nPublic Participation′=21.005\n\nWoman with an income of 2 has a predicted score of:\n\nPublic Participation′=5.762+3.475∗2+4.818 ∗ 0\n\nPublic Participation′=12.712\n\nDifference = 21,005 – 12,712\n\nDifference = 8.293\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe previously computed the mean difference in public participation for men and women, which was 6.50.\n\nWhy is this previous mean difference not the same as the effect of gender that we find in this most recent regression analysis?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nThe mean difference as observed in the sample is the mean difference without controlling for income differences.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, men and women also differ in the average income, and income differences between males and females may also explain differences in public participation. In the regression analyses, we controlled for income differences, which means that we “filtered out” the effect of income (the correct way to say it: we partialed out income effects). After controlling for income the effect of gender is somewhat smaller. Hence, the difference in public participation in the sample means is partly due to income differences.\n\n</div>\n\n \nOne researcher argues that there are gender differences in public participation, and gender differences in income, and that income additionally has an effect on public participation.\n\nIn this theoretical model, income is a <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Common cause</option><option value=''>Moderator</option><option value=''>Confounder</option><option value='answer'>Mediator</option></select>\n\n### Nested Models\n\nFinally, we might want to know how much unique variance is explained by gender, *after* controlling for income. To this end, we would perform a nested model test.\n\nConduct this test as you have done before, using the graphical interface or syntax. Remember: Enter Income first, then Gender - and ask for the $R^2$ change statistics.\n\nLet's inspect the Model Summary table.\n\nWhat percentage of the total variance in Participation is explained by Income (only)? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"39.1\"]'/>\n\nHow much of the total variance in Participation is explained by both Income and Gender? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"57.3\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the R2-change (in percentage) from Model 1 to Model 2? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='4' data-answer='[\"18.2\"]'/>\n\nThe Model Summary table also reports the results of the F-tests, which tests whether the change in R2 is significant.\n\nSuppose three researchers use the output to see whether the R2-change is significant. Researcher I tests at the 10% level, Researcher II tests at the 5% level, and Researcher III tests at the 1% level.\n\n\nWhich of the researchers will conclude that there is a significant result? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Only researcher III</option><option value=''>Only researcher II</option><option value='answer'>All three researchers</option><option value=''>Only researcher I</option></select> \n\nReport the results of your analysis (include all relevant statistics: test statistics, degrees of freedom, p-values).\n\nInclude in your answer:\n\n* The R2 of the Small and Full model.\n* The R2-change and whether or not it is significant (use a significance level of .05).\n* A substantive interpretation of the R2-change (within the context of this assignment).\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nIncome explains 39.1% of variance in Participation, which is significantly greater than zero, $F(1,41) = 26.32, p < .001$.\nGender explains an additional 18.2% of variance in Participation, and this difference significantly differs from zero, $\\Delta R^2 = .18, F(1,40) = 17.06, p < .001$. The total explained variance in Participation by Income and Gender is 55.2%, which is significantly different from zero, $F(2, 40) = 26.85, p < .001$.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n### One more Categorical Variable\n\nLet's finish this assignment by adding one more categorical variable, and seeing whether it has a significant unique effect after controlling for Income and Gender. We will use Education level, which has three categories. We thus have to create two dummy variables to account for this variable.\n\nFirst, make the dummy variables, using low Education status as reference category.\n\nRemember that these dummies together code for one variable, so you must add them to the model in the same step together.\n\nWhat is the F test statistic for the $\\Delta R^2$ test for adding Education to a model that already contains Income and Gender? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.352\",\".352\"]'/>\n\nWhat is the difference in expected Participation between someone with Low education status and High education status? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='6' data-answer='[\"-1.242\"]'/>\n",
