The problem with this approach is that linear regression predicts probabilities outside the range of [0, 1],\nand will have heteroscedastic and non-normal residuals because there are only two discrete values for the dependent variable.\n\n**Logistic Regression** overcomes these limitations of linear regression.\nThe core idea behind logistic regression is to predict a transformation of the dependent variable, Y, rather than the raw scores. Specifically, we model the **log odds** of the probability of Y being one category (e.g., 1) versus the other category (e.g., 0). The logit function, denoted as `log(p/(1-p))`, models the probability p using an s-shaped curve bounded by 0 and 1.\nFurthermore, logistic regression assumes a Bernoulli error distribution, instead of a normal error distribution, which accounts for the fact that observed outcomes can only take the values 0 or 1.\n\n## Introducing the logit\n\nLogistic regression predicts the **logit function** of the individual probabilities of observing the outcome, pi. The logit of the probability (pi) is given by `log(pi/(1-pi))`, ensuring that the predicted values remain within the valid probability range. The outcome, Yi, is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution with an individual probability of success, pi. The logit of this success probability is modeled as a linear function of the predictors, allowing us to use the familiar linear regression model to predict the logit of pi.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between **probability**, **odds**, and the **logit** is crucial in logistic regression. Probability is defined as the long-run proportion of outcomes of a random experiment in which a particular outcome is observed.\nOdds describe the ratio of the probability of an event occurring relative to the probability of it not occurring. Finally, the logit transforms odds into a linear function, enabling us to use the regression model. The transformations from probability to odds and logit, and back, are given by:\n\nOperation | Formula\n----------|---------\nProbability to odds | $\\text{odds}= \\frac{P}{1-P}$\nOdds to probability  | $P = \\frac{\\text{odds}}{1+\\text{odds}}$\nOdds to logit | \t\t$\\text{logit} = \\ln(odds)$\nLogit to odds | $\\text{odds} = e^{\\text{logit}}$\nProbability to logit | $\\text{logit} = \\ln(\\frac{p}{1-p})$\nLogit to probability  | $p = \\frac{e^{logit}}{1+e^{logit}}$\n\n## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n\nIn traditional linear regression, we use \"ordinary least squares\" (OLS) estimation to obtain the model parameters. This method involves simple matrix algebra and always yields a unique solution. However, for logistic regression, there is no OLS solution due to the binary nature of the dependent variable. Instead, we turn to **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**. A complete explanation is beyond the scope of this course, but here is a basic intuitive explanation of the procedure: \n\n1. Start with random values for the coefficients (a and b)\n2. Using those parameter values, calculate the individual probabilities predicted by the logistic regression formula\n3. For each individual, calculate the likelihood of observing their true outcome in a Bernoulli distribution with model-implied probability pi\n4. Multiply these probabilities across all individuals to get the overall likelihood of observing these data, given the chosen coefficient values\n5. Adjust the values of a and b a little bit\n6. Check if the likelihood has become larger\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until until we find the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood and no further improvement can be found.\n\nIn other words, we look for the values of a and b that maximize the likelihood  of observing the observed outcome values.\n\n## Interpreting Coefficients\n\nThe **intercept (a)** represents the log odds of the outcome (Y) for someone who scores 0 on all predictors. We can convert this log odds to the probability of the outcome for an individual who scores 0 on all predictors using the formula `P = e^(a) / (1 + e^(a))`. We can also solve for the inflection point at which the model stops predicting 0 and starts predicting 1, or vice versa, using $X_{p = .5} = \\frac{-a}{b}$.\n\nThe **slope (b)** of the logistic regression equation determines how steeply the logistic function switches from predicting 0 to predicting 1 as the predictor variable (Xi) increases. Larger absolute values of b indicate a steeper transition between the two outcomes. If the slope is positive, the function ascends (starts at 0 and goes to 1), resulting in an S-shaped curve. Conversely, if the slope is negative, the function descends (starts at 1 and goes to 0), resulting in a Z-shaped curve.\n\n## Odds Ratio\n\nThe **odds ratio** is another important concept when interpreting logistic regression coefficients. It represents the odds of the outcome occurring given a one-unit increase in the predictor variable (Xi), relative to the odds of the outcome occurring when Xi remains unchanged. For binary predictors (e.g., conditions), the odds ratio provides a sensible effect size. For continuous predictors, the odds ratio is a multiplyer by which the odds increase when the predictor increases by one unit.\n\nTo calculate the odds ratio for a logistic regression coefficient (b), we use the formula `OR = e^(b)`. A value greater than 1 indicates that the predictor is associated with higher odds of the outcome, while a value less than 1 indicates lower odds of the outcome. For example, if the odds ratio for the test score coefficient (b = 2.12) is 8.35, it means that for each unit increase in the test score, the odds of the outcome are multiplied by 8.35.\n\n\n## Model Fit\n\nTo assess how well the logistic regression model fits the data, we can use the likelihood obtained from maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). By multiplying the log likelihood by -2, we obtain the $-2LL$, which is a chi-square distributed test statistic. Performing a chi-square test allows us to determine if the overall model is significant. The null hypothesis is that the model does not significantly differ from a model with no predictors. If the chi-square test is significant, it indicates that the model provides a better fit than a null model.\n\n## Likelihood Ratio Test\n\nIn logistic regression, we can also conduct a **Likelihood Ratio (LR) test**, which is a chi-square test for the difference in log likelihood between two nested models, $-2LL_0 - -2LL_1$. The first model is the restricted model with fewer parameters, and the second is the full model with more parameters. The LR test helps us compare the two models and determine if the additional predictors in the full model significantly improve its fit. The degrees of freedom for the LR test are equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models.\n\n## Pseudo R2\n\nUnlike linear regression, logistic regression doesn't have a traditional R-squared to measure explained variance. However, researchers have proposed several **Pseudo R2** statistics to approximate the concept of explained variance in logistic regression. These Pseudo R2 statistics rescale the -2 log likelihood of the model. Two common Pseudo R2 statistics are Cox & Snell and Nagelkerke.\n\nCox & Snell is a generalization of the \"normal\" R2, which provides the same value for ordinary least squares regression. For logistic regression, however, its value can never reach 1; it will be somewhere between 0 and < 1. Nagelkerke aims to \"fix\" this property by rescaling Cox & Snell to a range of [0, 1], by dividing it by its maximum possible value. While these statistics can provide a measure of relative model fit and help compare models on the same dataset, they do not represent absolute model fit or effect size.\n\n## Classification Accuracy\n\nOne way to evaluate the model's predictive performance is by using a **classification table**. The classification table compares the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes to determine how well the model predicts true positives and true negatives. The table is constructed by calculating the predicted probability for each individual and then dichotomizing these probabilities using a specific cutoff, typically 0.5. Individuals with predicted probabilities above the cutoff are classified as \"1,\" and those below as \"0.\" The observed outcomes are then cross-tabulated against the dichotomized predictions.\n\nBy examining the classification table, we can assess the accuracy of the model's predictions and identify areas of improvement. Researchers could choose a different cutoff to optimize the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, depending on the specific goals of the analysis.\n\nIn summary, evaluating logistic regression models involves assessing model fit through chi-square tests, using Pseudo R2 statistics for relative fit comparison, and examining classification accuracy to understand the model's predictive performance.\n\n# Lecture\n\n\n\n# Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

In that case we cannot use linear regression because several of the assumptions of linear regression are violated.\n\n```{=latex}\n\n\\end{tcolorbox}\n```\n \n\nIn a study concerning the smoking behavior amongst adolescents, a logistic regression analysis is conducted to check the effect of the image of smoking (Image) on smoking behavior (Smoking).\n\nImage: to what degree the young adult thinks smoking is perceived as “cool”.\nThe variable image is measured on a scale from 10 to 30, in which higher scores indicate that smoking is perceived as cooler.\n\nSmoking: whether or not the adolescent smokes.\n\n* 0 = the adolescent is a non-smoker\n* 1 = the adolescent is a smoker\n \n\nBelow you can find part of the output the researchers retrieved.\n\n![](images/Figure 5-2.png)\n\nFirst, write down the estimated regression model.\n\n\n```{=latex}\n\n\\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=Answer]\n\n```\n\n\n\n$Logit(Smoking = 1) = -5.65 + 0.28*Image$\n \n\n```{=latex}\n\n\\end{tcolorbox}\n```\n\n\nWhat is the probability that an adolescent with a score of 15 on image smokes? ____^[0\\.33]\n \nTake a look at the regression coefficient.\n\n![](images/Figure 5-1-1.png)\n\nImagine that one's score on Image will increase from 15 to 16.\n\nTo what degree will the logit and odds change?\n\nAnd what can you conclude about the increase in probability?\n\n\n\n\n```{=latex}\n\n\\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=Answer]\n\n```\n\nThe logit increases with 0.284.
