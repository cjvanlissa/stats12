In a simple bivariate linear regression, we use the equation:\n\n$Y_i = a + b \\cdot X_i + e_i$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $Y_i$ represents an individual's score on the dependent variable $Y$.\n- $a$ is the intercept coefficient of the regression line.\n- $b$ is the slope coefficient of the regression line.\n- $X_i$ is an individual's score on the independent variable $X$.\n- $e_i$ is the prediction error for individual $i$.\n\nThe regression line provides us with predicted values based on the model. It can be represented as:\n\n$\\hat{Y}_i = a + b \\cdot X_i$\n\nWhere $Y^i$ is the predicted score for individual $i$ on the dependent variable $Y$.\n\n## Introducing Interactions\n\nNow, let's take our regression analysis to the next level by introducing the concept of interactions. An interaction implies that the effect of one predictor variable depends on the level of another predictor variable.\n\nTo incorporate interactions, we add a special building block to our regression equation:\n\n$Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3(X_1 \\times X_2)$\n\nTo include an interaction term in your regression model:\n\n1. Calculate a new variable as the product of the two interacting variables.\n2. Add this interaction term to the regression equation along with the original variables. **Note:** You should never include an interaction term in the model without including its constituent terms!\n\nIn summary, interactions add a new layer of complexity to regression analysis by acknowledging that the relationships between variables can be contingent on other factors. By incorporating interactions, we can gain deeper insights into the nuanced dynamics between predictors and outcomes in our statistical models.\n\n## Interaction between one Continuous and one Binary Predictor\n\nInteraction is easiest to explain using one binary predictor, coded as 0 and 1, and one continuous predictor. \n\nRecall that using this type of \"dummy coding\" allows us to represent different intercepts for the two groups in our regression model. The intercept of the regression equation applies to the group coded 0 (the reference group), and the intercept of the group coded 1 is equal to the overall intercept plus the effect of the dummy variable. In formulas this is represented as:\n\n\\begin{align}\nY &= a + bD \\text{, where D} \\in(0,1)\\\\\nY_{D=0} &= a + b*0 = a\\\\\nY_{D=1} &= a + b*1 = a + b\n\\end{align}\n\nAn interaction implies that not only the intercept but also the regression slope differs between two groups. Imagine we add continuous predictor $X$ to the model, as well as the interaction term $D*X$:\n\n\\begin{align}\nY &= a + b_1D + b_2X +b_3 (D*X)\n\\end{align}\n\n\nIn some cases, we might want to estimate not only distinct intercepts but also distinct slopes for different groups. For instance, we might be interested in understanding how the effect of gender role attitudes on involvement differs for men and women.\n\nThe complete formula for the regression line varies based the value of dummy variable $D$:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nY_{D=0} &= a + b_1*0 + b_2X +b_3 (0*X) = a + b_2X\\\\\nY_{D=1} &= a + b_1*1 + b_2X +b_3 (1*X) = (a + b_1) + (b_2 + b_3)X\n\\end{align}\n\n\nNote that both groups' regression equations can be simplified into a basic linear formula of the form $a + bX$, except that they each have a unique value for the intercept and regression slope! This is how interaction terms allow you to make the effect of one variable contingent on the value of another.\n\nIf the interaction term is significant (i.e., the slope for the product of the interacting variables), we conclude that there is significant interaction and the slope of the effect of one interacting variable depends on the value of the other interacting variable.\n\n## Simple Effects\n\nWhen the interaction between a binary moderator and a continuous predictor is significant, we often want to know how big the regression effect of the continuous predictor is in each group of the binary predictor. This is called simple effects analysis.\n\nOne straightforward way to perform simple effects analysis involves creating dummy variables for both categories of the binary moderator and computing interaction terms with these dummies. Then, specifying two regression models with different reference categories. This gives the effect of the continuous moderator for each group, along with a significance test.\n\n## Interaction with Two Continuous Predictors\n\nWhen we previously discussed interaction effects involving one binary and one continuous predictor, we discovered that such interactions result in distinct regression lines for each unique value of the binary predictor. Now, consider an interaction between two continuous predictors. In this scenario, each variable can theoretically take infinite possible values. Therefore, we can no longer think of this as a distinct regression line for each value of the moderator. Instead, we can imagine how an increase in the value of one interacting variable leads to an adjustment of the effect of the other interacting variable.\n\nTo grasp the concept of interaction effects with two continuous predictors, let's dive into a concrete example. Imagine we're investigating the relationship between outcome Y, and continuous predictors X1 and X2. We've determined the coefficients for our regression model:\n\n$Y = 12.50 + 1.50 \\cdot X_{1} - 0.20 \\cdot X_{2} + 0.07 \\cdot (X_{1} \\times X_{2})$\n\nLet's do the same we did for understanding the regression equation with a binary moderator, and simplify it by plugging in a specific value for one of the interacting variables. Suppose we want to know the effect of X1 for someone who scores 0 on the continuous variable X2:\n\n$Y = 12.50 + 1.50 \\cdot X_{1} - 0.20 \\cdot 0 + 0.07 \\cdot (X_{1} \\times 0) = 12.50 + \\textbf{1.50} \\cdot X_{1}$\n\nThe effect for such a person is 1.50. Now, let's compare this to a person who scores 1 on the continuous variable X2:\n\n$Y = 12.50 + 1.50 \\cdot X_{1} - 0.20 \\cdot 1 + 0.07 \\cdot (X_{1} \\times 1) = (12.50-0.20) + (1.50 + 0.07) \\cdot X_1 = 12.30 + \\textbf{1.57} \\cdot X_1$\n\nNow, the effect of $X_1$ has increased by 0.07 - which was exactly the size of the regression slope for the interaction term.\n\n## Centering for Interpretability\n\nWhen working with interactions between two continuous predictors, it's essential to center the variables. Centering aids interpretability - the effect of one predictor is now given for the average value of the other predictors. Moreover, centering avoids artificial multicollinearity between the two interacting variables and their interaction term.\n\n### Simple Slopes\n\nIf the interaction effect between two continuous predictors is significant, we might want to understand how the effect of one of the interacting predictors varies across levels of the other interacting predictor. This is similar to the simple effects approach from before, except now it's called simple slopes.\n\nInstead of computing the effect of one variable for all unique values of a binary moderator, we pick specific values of the continuous moderator - typically +/- 1SD - and calculate the effect of the other predictor at those specific values.\n\nBy centering the interacting predictors at their mean value +/- 1SD and re-computing the interaction term using those transformed predictors, we obtain simple slopes at different levels of the moderator. Note that centering at $M + 1SD$ gives us the effect for people who score 1SD **below** the mean (you're sliding the distribution to the right on the number line, until people who used to score -1SD are centered at 0).\n\n# Lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGj_t72VJPk >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Formative Test\n\nComplete the formative test ideally after you’ve seen the lecture, but before the lecture meeting in which we can discuss any topics that need more attention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n**Question 1**\n\nAn interaction effect is when... ^[The effect of one predictor depends on the value of another predictor.]\n\n* (A) The effect of one predictor is added to the effect of another predictor.  \n* (B) The effect of one predictor depends on the value of another predictor.  \n* (C) The effect of two predictors is cumulative.  \n* (D) You interact with your partipants.  \n\n\n\n**Question 2**\n\nWhat is the purpose of centering continuous predictors in interaction analysis? ^[Centering continuous predictors helps in enhancing interpretability and reducing multicollinearity.]\n\n* (A) Centering continuous predictors helps in enhancing interpretability and reducing multicollinearity.  \n* (B) Centering continuous predictors increases interpretability.  \n* (C) Centering continuous predictors prevents multicollinearity.  \n* (D) Centering continuous predictors is necessary for regression analysis to provide correct results.  \n\n\n\n**Question 3**\n\nWhen two continuous predictors interact, how many unique regression lines are generated? ^[A theoretically infinite number of unique regression lines, as both predictors can take on an infinite number of values.]\n\n* (A) Two unique regression lines are generated, one for each predictor.  \n* (B) Only one unique regression line is generated regardless of the interaction.  \n* (C) A theoretically infinite number of unique regression lines, as both predictors can take on an infinite number of values.  \n* (D) The number of unique regression lines depends on the number of unique values of the predictors.  \n\n\n\n**Question 4**\n\nWhat is the concept of simple slopes in interaction analysis? ^[Simple slopes refer to the effect of one predictor variable, evaluated at specific levels of another variable.]\n\n* (A) Simple slopes refer to the effect of one predictor variable, evaluated at specific levels of another variable.  \n* (B) Simple slopes are the slopes of predictors before they are centered.  \n* (C) Simple slopes refer to the linear effects of a predictor on the outcome variable.  \n* (D) Simple slopes are the partial effects of two predictors, controlling for their interaction effect.  \n\n\n\n**Question 5**\n\nIn a multiple regression model with two continuous predictors, how would you assess the effect of one predictor at different levels of the other predictor? ^[By centering one predictor at a specific level and re-computing the interaction term.]\n\n* (A) By standardizing the predictors.  \n* (B) By excluding the interaction term from the model.  \n* (C) By computing the mean of both predictors.  \n* (D) By centering one predictor at a specific level and re-computing the interaction term.  \n\n\n\n**Question 6**\n\nWhat does it mean when an interaction term in a regression model is not significant? ^[When an interaction term is not significant, it suggests that the effect of one predictor variable on the outcome variable is consistent across all levels of the other predictor variable.]\n\n* (A) An insignificant interaction term indicates a problem with the data collection process.  \n* (B) When an interaction term is not significant, it suggests that the effect of one predictor variable on the outcome variable is consistent across all levels of the other predictor variable.  \n* (C) An insignificant interaction term means that the outcome variable is not related to the predictor variables.  \n* (D) An insignificant interaction term indicates that the model is overfitting.  \n\n\n\n**Question 7**\n\nWhat is the predicted value for an individual with a score of 2.5 on X1 and score of 35 on X2, given the following regression equation: Y = 10 + 2 * X1 - 0.5 * X2 + 0.1 * (X1 * X2)? ^[6.25]\n\n* (A) -3.75  \n* (B) 8.75  \n* (C) -2.4  \n* (D) 6.25  \n\n\n\n**Question 8**\n\nWhat is the effect of a one-unit increase in X1 on the predicted value for an individual who scores 40 on X2, given the following regression equation: Y = 8 + 1.2 * X1 - 0.3 * X2 + 0.05 * (X1 * X2)? ^[3.2]\n\n* (A) 0.1  \n* (B) 3.2  \n* (C) 1.5  \n* (D) 1.2  \n\n\n\n**Question 9**\n\nAssume that X1 and X2 are centered around the mean.

Public participation involves being member of school boards, municipal councillor, etc.\n\nIn this assignment we will see how we can model interaction between a continuous predictor and a dichotomous predictor. \n\nSuppose we are interested in relationship between age and public participation, and we want to know if the relationship is moderated by gender. \nAn interaction model is conceptually represented as follows (these two diagrams are interchangeable):\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/y_on_x1x2int2.png)\n\n![](images/y_on_x1x2int1.png)\n\n\n:::\n\n\nModeling Interactions\n\nThe regression model for testing the interaction is:\n\n$Y' = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}D_{g} + b_{3}XD_{g}$\n\nwhere  X = age, and D_g = gender (0 = women; 1 = men). Notice that women are our reference group.\n\nTo model interaction we need to create a new variable, which is the product of the dummy variable (gender in our case) and  (age in our case).\n\nThis is best done via syntax, but to use the graphical interface proceed as follows: \n\nvia Transform > compute variable \n\nGive the new variable a name (i.e., the target variable), say GenderTAge. \n\nThen specify the product at the right (see more information button). Click on Paste, select and run the code. Check in Data View whether the product term was added correctly.\n\nAlternatively, the syntax is:\n\n```\nCOMPUTE GenderTAge = Gender * Age.\nEXECUTE.\n```\n\nNow run the regression analysis that includes the interaction effect.\n\n**Important:** Just like with dummies you must include all dummies that belong to the same variable in the model together, with an interaction term, you must always include its constituent variables as well. This is because the interaction term only *modifies* the effect of its constituent variables; the effect of those constituent variables must thus also be in the model.\n\nSo, if you add variable intXTZ into the model, you must also include X and Z.\n\nVia analyze > regression > linear; choose age, gender and GenderTAge as the independent variables, and public participation as the dependent variable. \n\nConsult the table Regression coefficients.

Verify that SPSS added a new column with a dummy variable where males are the reference group.\n\n- Compute the product variable for the interaction between age and gender but now use the dummy having males as reference group.\n\n- Rerun the regression analysis, but now using the new gender variable and interaction term. If you're answer in the previous step is correct you should find the values back in the table Regression Coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n## Categorical Predictors with Three or more Categories\n\nThe categorical predictor Education has three levels (low, middle, high).

You have to enter gender * sccowork to compute the product of gender and sccowork. \n- Paste and run the syntax, and check whether the product variable was added\n\n \n\nConduct a multiple regression analysis (using Analyze > Regression > Linear) with scemoti as dependent variable. The independent variables are the main effects (gender and sccowork) and the interaction effect (genderTsccowork).\n\nWhat is the p-value of the interaction effect? _____^[0\\.083]\n\nTrue or false: The interaction effect is significant at $\\alpha = .10$ TRUE / FALSE^[TRUE]\n \n\nThe regression equation for the entire sample is:\n\n$\\text{scemoti}'=$ ______^[27\\.166] \n$+$ ______^[-7\\.103] $*\\text{Gender}+$\n______^[-0\\.237] $*\\text{Relationship}+$\n_____^[0\\.439] $*(\\text{Gender}*\\text{Relationship})$\n\n\nFor males, the value of Gender is 0. That means that GenderTRelco is also 0. The regression equation for males then becomes:\n\n$\\text{scemoti}'=$ ______^[27\\.166] \n______^[-0\\.237] $*\\text{Relationship}$\n\nFor females, the value of Gender is 1. What is the regression equation for females?\n\n$\\text{scemoti}'=$ ______^[20\\.063] \n$+$ \n_____^[0\\.202] $*\\text{Relationship}$\n\nDraw (on paper, not in SPSS) a schematic graph of the interaction effect. Put relationship with coworkers on the X-axis, and emotional pressure on the Y-axis. Draw a schematic regression line for each group. \n\n\nIn what group is the effect of relationship with coworkers on emotional pressure the strongest: males or females? ^[Males]\n\n* (A) Males  \n* (B) Females  \n\n \n\n\nIn practice, you'd often want to know whether the effects within the groups are significant.\n\nCan you use the output of this regression analysis to draw conclusions about the significance of the effect within each group? ^[Yes, but only for the group of males]\n\n* (A) No  \n* (B) Yes, but only for the group of males  \n* (C) Yes, but only for the group of females  \n* (D) Yes, for both groups  \n\n\n\nAt this moment, we don't have enough information in the output yet to test the effect within the female group. But we can test the effect within the male group! \n\nWhat is the p-value of the effect of sccowork on scemoti within the male group? _____^[0\\.237]\n\nTo test the significance within the the group of females, we can simply switch the reference groups. \n\n- Make a new dummy variable called `male`, on which males score 1, and females 0\n- Compute a new product variable: `COMPUTE maleTsccowork = male * sccowork.`\n\nPerform a new regression analysis with these predictors. This is exactly the same analysis, but now with women as reference group instead of men.\n\nLook at the table with the estimated coefficients. What is the p-value of the effect of sccowork on scemoti within the female group? _____^[0\\.187]\n",
