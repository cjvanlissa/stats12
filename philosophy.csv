What is the main difference between deductive and inductive reasoning?,"Deductive reasoning guarantees the conclusion if the premises are true, while inductive reasoning does not.",Inductive reasoning guarantees conclusions; deductive does not.,Deductive reasoning is used in science; inductive is not.,There is no real difference; both produce valid conclusions.,"Deductive reasoning leads to necessarily true conclusions if the premises are true, while inductive reasoning involves probable conclusions based on patterns."
Which of the following is an example of inductive reasoning?,"The sun has always risen in the east, so it will rise in the east tomorrow.","All humans are mortal, so Socrates is mortal.",Students who study more get better grades.,Water boils at 100 degrees at sea level.,"Assuming that the sun will rise tomorrow because it always has is an example of induction, and it is not logically justified."
What is the role of deduction in statistical hypothesis testing?,It is used to derive specific predictions from general theories.,It is used to generalize observations to populations.,It tests if data supports any hypothesis.,It determines the sample size needed.,"Deduction is used to derive derive specific, testable predictions from general theories, such as expecting a correlation between study time and grades if studying improves performance."
What was Karl Popper’s proposed solution to the problem of induction?,Falsification: trying to disprove theories rather than prove them.,Using more data to confirm theories.,Only using observational data.,Renouncing inductively constructed theories as pseudoscience.,"Popper argued that science should focus on rejecting falsifiable hypotheses rather than confirming them, avoiding the pitfalls of induction."
"In Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), what role does the null hypothesis play?",It merely exists to be refuted.,It reflects the researcher’s true belief.,It provides definitive proof of a theory.,It shows causality when rejected.,"The null hypothesis is a 'straw man' hypothesis, only intended to be rejected. This interpretation of Popper’s falsificationism actually never submits theories to the test, and aligns more closely with confirmationism."
What does the phrase 'correlation does not imply causation' mean?,A statistical association may not reflect a true causal relationship.,Causal relationships cannot be studied using statistics.,Don't use a correlation coefficient if the effect is causal.,Causation can only be studied with regression.,"No statistical finding can prove causation, so a correlation (or other type of association) between two variables doesn't confirm a causal link."
"According to a common interpretation of Hume, which three conditions are necessary for causality?","Association, temporal precedence, and non-spuriousness.","Randomization, generalization, and verification.","Falsifiability, deduction, and experimentation.","Observation, correlation, and prediction.","A common interpretation of Hume is that for a cause-effect relationship, the variables must be associated, the cause must precede the effect, and other explanations must be ruled out."
How do randomized controlled experiments support causal inference?,They eliminate alternative explanations through random assignment.,They always prove causality through replication.,They eliminate the need for statistical testing.,They confirm inductive conclusions.,"Random assignment maximizes the probability that the treatment and control groups do not differ on any confounding variables, thus ensuring nonspuriousness. Furthermore, a well-designed experiment ensures association (if there is an effect) and temporal precedence."
