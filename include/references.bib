  abstract = {Theories are the vehicle of cumulative knowledge acquisition. At this time, however, many (developmental) psychological theories are insufficiently precise to derive testable hypotheses. This limits the advancement of our principled understanding of development. This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data-driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results. It can assist in phenomenon detection and offers a more holistic understanding of the phenomena associated with an outcome or process of interest.},

  abstract = {In the last decade it has become clear that replicability of empirical psychological research should be better. Open science practices aim to enhance the transparency of research thereby both enabling others to reproduce the results presented in a paper and increasing the replicability of these results using new data. Examples of these practices include preregistration, publication of data and analyses, open access publications, and replication research. Although open science practices are gaining traction, they have rarely been placed in a broader epistemological context. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the open empirical cycle. It draws upon De Groot's empirical cycle, a model of cumulative knowledge generation via scientific research. The open empirical cycle is a pragmatic guide for researchers that includes and links to open science practices. Adhering to the open empirical cycle, if only partly, will structure the scientific workflow and create awareness of the adverse consequences of deviations. Following the open empirical cycle increases the transparency, quality, trustworthiness, and replicability of research. The open empirical cycle presented in this paper focusses on hypothesis evaluation using quantitative data in psychology. However, it can straightforwardly be applied to hypothesis evaluation in other social and behavioral sciences and biomedical sciences. It brings together ideas from de Groot's empirical cycle, traditional, and open research steps, key references, and open science tools, thereby providing a pragmatic, contemporary, and structured approach to hypothesis evaluation.},

  abstract = {The replication crisis has led many researchers to preregister their hypotheses and data analysis plans before collecting data.A widely held view is that preregistration is supposed to limit the extent to which data may influence the hypotheses to be tested.Only if data have no influence an analysis is considered confirmatory. Consequently, many researchers believe that preregistration is only applicable in confirmatory paradigms.In practice, researchers may struggle to preregister their hypotheses because of vague theories that necessitate data-dependent decisions (aka exploration).We argue that preregistration benefits any study on the continuum between confirmatory and exploratory research.To that end, we formalize a general objective of preregistration and demonstrate that exploratory studies also benefit from preregistration.Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we argue that preregistration should primarily aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive results.This approach provides a principled justification of preregistration, separating the procedure from the goal of ensuring strictly confirmatory research.We acknowledge that knowing the extent to which a study is exploratory is central, but certainty about the inferential procedure is a prerequisite for persuasive evidence.Finally, we discuss the implications of these insights for the practice of preregistration.},
