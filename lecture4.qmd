# Statistical Testing

## Sampling theory

```{r}
#| out.width = "90%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/sample_population.png")
```

## Inferential statistics

Using sample data to infer properties of the population

We previously covered estimation

* Using sample statistics as best guess of population parameters
* Using standard errors to express uncertainty about the accuracy of that guess
* $M$ is an estimate of $\mu$
* $SE_M$ indicates our uncertainty about that estimate

## More inferential statistics

Hypothesis testing is another inferential procedure

* Drawing conclusions about the population based on the sample
* These conclusions are based on calculated probabilities
* We use the normal distribution (as before)

## Intuitive example {.smaller}

1. Observation: Your car won’t start.
2. Theory: The battery is dead.
3. Hypothesis: If the battery is dead, then...
    + Using jumper cables will start the car
    + Charging the battery will start the car
    + Replacing the battery will start the car
4. Experiment: You replace the battery.
5. Data: The car starts.
6. Conclusion: The battery was indeed dead.

## Statistical testing

In the previous example, all you need to test the hypothesis is one piece of evidence

* Car starts or not

**Statistical hypothesis tests** instead use probability calculus

* This allows you to test hypotheses in the presence of uncertainty


## Intuitive example, adapted

1. Observation: 6% of Brand X cars have trouble starting within the first year.
2. Theory: The battery has too low capacity.
3. Hypothesis: If the battery is dead, then...
  + Increasing battery capacity will solve the problem.
4. Experiment: Brand X switches to larger batteries.
5. Data: In a sample of 1000 Brand X cars,  
   4.3% have trouble starting within the first year.
6. Conclusion: ?

Is this improvement significant, relative to random variation between samples?


## Steps for testing {.smaller}

1. Formulate hypotheses  
    + <font color = "gray">Testable proposition about population parameters</font>
2. Calculate test statistic
    + <font color = "gray">Describes how many standard errors away from the population statistic under the null hypothesis the sample statistic is</font>
3. Calculate p-value
    + <font color = "gray">Probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the sample statistic, if $H_0$ were true</font>
4.  Draw conclusion about null hypothesis
    + <font color = "gray">(Act as if) we reject or fail to reject it</font>

# Hypotheses

## Theory vs. Hypothesis

Theory: 

* Systematic explanation for phenomena
* Can include assumptions about causality

Hypothesis:

* Proposition about the population that can be tested in a sample
* Assumption about the state of the world that is put to the test
* Must be made before seeing the results

## Falsificationism {.smaller}

Testing builds on Popper's falsificationism

* Tests can only cast doubt on hypotheses, not provide evidence for them
* Therefore, the tested hypothesis is often the **opposite** of what the researcher believes
* You will see a lot of "null hypotheses":
    + Hypothesis that a value / difference / effect is equal to zero
    + If this hypothesis is rejected, we act as if there **is** a non-zero effect
    + Software often uses null hypotheses by default
* Criticism: the hypothesis is a "straw man", nobody believes it, its only purpose is to be rejected
* Alternatives: Bayesian statistics, informative hypothesis tests, smallest effect of interest

## What kind of hypotheses?

Equality hypotheses:

* $H: \mu = 0$
* $H: \mu = 6.4$, which is the same as $H: \mu - 6.4 = 0$
* $H: \mu_1 = \mu_2$, which is the same as $H: (\mu_1 - \mu2) = 0$

Inequality hypotheses

* Larger or smaller
* $H: \mu > 0$
* $H: \mu < 6.4$, which is the same as $H: \mu - 6.4 < 0$
* $H: \mu_1 > \mu_2$, which is the same as $H: (\mu_1 - \mu2) > 0$

## Null and alternative hypotheses {.smaller}

The null hypothesis exists only to be rejected,  
the alternative hypothesis reflects the researcher's true beliefs

$H_0$ vs. $H_A$

There are two philosophies of testing:

* Fisher:
    + Implicit alternative hypothesis which is mutually exclusive with $H_0$
    + If $H_0: \mu = 0$, then $H_A: \mu \neq 0$
    + If $H_0: \mu \leq 0$, then $H_A: \mu > 0$
* Neyman-Pearson:
    + Explicit alternative hypothesis for specific expected effect size
    + E.g., $H_0: \mu = 0$, $H_A: \mu = 6.4$
    + By stating what effect size we expect,  
      we can calculate the probability of finding an effect that really exists

# Test statistics

## What is a test statistic {.smaller}

Simple definition: 

* Distance between the hypothesized population value and the sample statistic, in standard errors
* In other words: We standardize that distance by dividing by standard errors

We use the familiar formula for the Z-distribution to obtain the Z test statistic:

$Z = \frac{M - \mu_0}{SE_\mu}$

* $M$ is the sample mean
* $\mu_0$ is the expected population mean under $H_0$
* $SE_\mu$ is the standard error

## Calculate test statistic

```{r out.height = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hypothesistest.png", dpi = NA)
```

E.g.: $H_0: \mu = 6.4, SE_\mu = .2$, and $M = 6.8$

* The test statistic is $Z = \frac{M - \mu_0}{SE_\mu} = \frac{6.8 - 6.4}{.2} = 2$

## Example

Dutch people are quite tall. Worldwide distribution: $~N(\mu = 167, \sigma = 7.5)$ 

Hypothesis: Dutch people are significantly taller than the worldwide average.

Sample: Convenience sample of 20 students, $M = 171$

* $H_0: \mu_0 \leq 167$: The population mean is 167 or smaller
* $H_a: \mu_0 > 167$: The population mean exceeds 167

$Z = \frac{M-\mu_0}{SE_\mu} = \frac{171-167}{7.5/\sqrt20} = 2.39$

$SE_M = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

# P-value

## The p-value

Statistical hypothesis tests use probability calculus

What probability?

**Definition**: Probability of observing data at least as extreme as our sample data, IF our (null) hypothesis were true.

$P(Data | H_0)$

## Correct interpretation {.smaller}

* P-values give you the probability of observing certain data, ASSUMING THAT $H_0$ is true
* They do NOT give you the probability of $H_0$ being true or false!

$p = .0001$
    + Correct: it's extremely unlikely to observe these data if we assume that $H_0$ is true
    + INCORRECT: there's a (1-.0001) = .9999 probability that $H_0$ is false

$p = .75$:
    + Correct: it's very common to observe these data if $H_0$ is true
    + Incorrect: 75% probability that $H_0$ is true

To make probability statements about hypotheses, you need to use a different (Bayesian) definition of probability

## Use the normal distribution

First, determine if you need the probability in one tail, or both

* One-sided hypothesis ($H_0: \mu \leq / \geq$? One tailed
* Two-sided hypothesis ($H_0: \mu = $)? Two-tailed

SPSS (and many other programs) only give two-tailed p-value

* If the effect is in the hypothesized direction, divide $p/2$
    + If not, it's non-significant, but you don't know the $p$

## What to do with the p-value?

Two philosophies:

**1. Fisher:**

* Specify only a null hypothesis $H_0$
* p-value quantifies incompatibility of the data with $H_0$
* The more incompatible (i.e., smaller p-value), the more skeptical we become of $H_0$

## What to do with the p-value? {.smaller}

**2. Neyman-Pearson:**

* Specific null- and alternative hypothesis
* Determine alpha and beta level
  + Alpha conventionally set at .05
  + Beta < .2 considered to be desirable (power analysis)
* p-value compared against alpha to make a decision
  + Binary decision; does not matter how much smaller
* Still report exact p-values so other researchers can use different approaches to inference


# Conclusion

## Reject null hypothesis

We reject $H_0$ when:

* $p < \alpha$

This means that it's very unlikely to observe data at least as extreme as we observed, assuming $H_0$ is true

## Don't reject null hypothesis

We don't reject $H_0$ when:

* $p \geq \alpha$:

This means that the data are unsurprising, assuming $H_0$ is true

## Critical Values

Critical values are the Z-values corresponding to the chosen $\alpha$ level

* $\alpha = P(Z > Z_{\text{critical}})$
* So we also reject $H_0$ when the test statistic exceeds the critical value, $Z > Z_{\text{critical}}$
* These are the same thing, because you look up $p$ using the $Z-value$

Memorize the following critical values:

* For two-sided test and $\alpha = .05$, the critical value is 1.96 (~2)
* For one-sided test and $\alpha = .05$, the critical value is 1.64


## Type I and Type II errors

When we test hypotheses, we (act as if) we accept or reject $H_0$

You could make two errors:

* Rejecting $H_0$ but in reality $H_0$ was true
    + False-positive finding
    + Incorrectly concluding you've found something (an effect, a difference, etc)
* Accepting $H_0$ but in reality $H_a$ is true
    + False negative
    + Concluding you've found nothing, but there was an effect out there

## Type I and Type II errors

```{r}
df <- data.frame("Decision" = c("Reject H0", "Accept H0"), "Ha" = c("Correct decision!", "<font color = 'red'>Type II error: $\\beta$</font>"), "H0" = c("<font color = 'red'>Type I error: $\\alpha$</font>", "Correct decision!"), check.names = FALSE)
#df <- df[2:1, c("Decision", "H0", "Ha")]
library(kableExtra)
kable(df, escape = FALSE, align = rep('l', length(df[,1]))) |>
  kable_styling("striped") |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Truth in population" = 2))
  
```

## Alpha en beta

Alpha is the risk of a false-positive finding

* Conventionally, we use $\alpha = .05$, 5% risk of Type I error

Beta is the risk of a false-negative finding

* If you specify a specific $H_a$, you can calculate $\beta$!
* In general, $\beta$ decreases if:
    + The effect size is greater
    + The sample is larger
    + There is less "noise" (lower standard deviation)

## Alpha and Beta are related

If you choose a lower $\alpha$, your $\beta$ will increase!

* Given a specific $H_a$, you can balance the risk of Type I/II Errors
* Justify your choice!
* E.g., COVID repid tests: $\alpha = .001, \beta = .50$
    + Is this the right balance? 
    + Consequence of false positive: infect other people, potentially get them very sick
    + Consequence of false negative: stay home unnecessarily

<!-- The shaded region represents beta. You can see how these are values that will be thought to be part of distribution A (support the null hypothesis) and thus have a negative test result. That is why they are considered a false negative. This type of testing error is called a type II error. -->

# Power

## Defining power {.smaller}

**Power:** Probability of correctly finding a true effect

* It is simply $1-\beta$
* If you specify an alternative hypothesis $H_a$, you can calculate $\beta$
    + This works well for simple tests, like Z-tests
* For complex tests, calculations can be more advanced
    + For *very* complex tests, people use "simulations": Generating many fake datasets based on the hypothesized effect, analyzing them, and calculating the % of times they find a significant effect (= power)

For more on the relationship between power and sample size, see https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.33267

## Intuitive perspective on power

It's like looking for something in a dark basement; your chance of finding it (= power) increases if:

* The object you're looking for is big (large effect)
* You search for longer (sample size)
* The basement is uncluttered (low noise/standard deviation)

# The t-distribution

## Can we always use the Z-distribution?

* To use the Z-distribution, you need $M, \mu_0,$ and $\sigma$

**Problem:** We rarely know $\sigma$

**Solution:** We estimate $\sigma$ using our sample SD

As explained in a previous lecture, we can then use

* $SE_M = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ instead of $SE_\mu = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

## Accounting for uncertainty

**Problem:** Estimating $\sigma$ using the sample SD introduces additional uncertainty (because SD is not EXACTLY equal to $\sigma$)

* If we don't account for this uncertainty, p-values will be too small
    + Leading us to reject the null hypothesis too easily
    + Increasing risk of false-positive findings!

**Solution:** We use a different distribution that gives slightly larger p-values

## t-distribution

The t-distribution is similar to the Z-distribution: $\bar{X} \sim t(\mu_0, SE_M, df)$

* $\mu_0$ is the population mean according to the null hypothesis
* $SE_M$ is the sample estimate of the standard error
* $df$ are the **degrees of freedom**: they control how thick the tails are
    + Lower $df$ -> thicker tails -> higher p-value for the same test statistic
* When $df \geq 30$ the distribution converges to the Z-distribution: $t_{n\geq30} \approx Z$

<!-- Recap that we have used the Normal Distribution as a "tool" to describe several things: The distribution of (observed) cases in our sample, AND the distribution of hypothetical means of many samples of the same size from the same population. -->


## t-test for a sample mean {.smaller}

**Same calculation as for the Z-test!**

Except you use SD instead of $\sigma$

* $H_0$: The population mean of height is 167,  
    $\mu_0 \leq 167$
* $H_a$: The population mean of height exceeds 167,  
    $\mu_0 > 167$
    
$SE_M = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$

Sample: Convenience sample of 20 students, $M = 171, SD = 8$, 

* $H_0: \mu_0 \leq 167$: The population mean is 167 or smaller
* $H_a: \mu_0 > 167$: The population mean exceeds 167

$t = \frac{M-\mu_0}{SE_M} = \frac{171-167}{8/\sqrt20} = 2.23$

## P-value for t-distribution

* In t-table in the book
* Using an online calculator, e.g. https://onecompiler.com/r: `pt(tvalue, df, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)`
    * Excel (2-tailed): `=T.DIST(ABS(tvalue), df)`
    * Divide by 2 to get one-tailed

# Examples

## Example 1

Do warning signs near roads (e.g., photos of heavy accidents) influence the average speed (tested at the 5% level)?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/onesample1.png")
```


## Example 1 steps {.smaller}

1. Formulate hypotheses  
    + $H_0: \mu_0 = 50$, $H_a: \mu_0 \neq 50$
2. Calculate test statistic
    + Do we know population $\sigma$? NO!
    + So, calculate t: $t = -1.76 = \frac{48.5 - 50}{6.5 / \sqrt{58}}$
3. Calculate p-value
    + Given by SPSS: $p = .084$
4.  Draw conclusion about null hypothesis
    + Fail to reject null hypothesis; data are not surprising if $H_0$ is true


## Example 1 one sided {.smaller}

But... we were trying to slow down cars! Doesn't this hypothesis make more sense? 

1. Formulate hypotheses  
    + $H_0: \mu_0 \geq 50$, $H_a: \mu_0 < 50$
2. Calculate test statistic
    + Do we know population $\sigma$? NO!
    + So, calculate t: $t = -1.76 = \frac{48.5 - 50}{6.5 / \sqrt{58}}$
3. Calculate p-value
    + Divide SPSS two-sided p-value by 2: $p = .084/2 = .042$
4.  Draw conclusion about null hypothesis
    + Reject null hypothesis; data are surprising if $H_0$ is true
    
## Reporting

On the road with signs, driving speed was significantly lower than the legal limit of 50km/h, $M = 48.50, t(57) = -1.76, p = .04$. The null hypothesis that driving speed would be greater than 50 was rejected.

## Example 2

Let's say one is alcoholic if one consumes $>20$ units of alcohol/week

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/onesample2.png")
```

## Example 2 critical value {.smaller}

1. Formulate hypotheses  
    + $H_0: \mu_0 \leq 20$, $H_a: \mu_0 > 20$
2. Calculate test statistic
    + Do we know population $\sigma$? NO!
    + So, calculate t: $t = 2.28 = \frac{26.57 - 20}{15.20 / \sqrt{28}}$
3. Let's use the critical value this time
4. Reject $H_0$ because $t = 2.28$ exceeds $t_{\text{critical}} = 1.703$
