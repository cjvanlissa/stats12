"Which argument is deductive?,All mammals are warm-blooded; whales are mammals; therefore whales are warm-blooded.,All mammals are warm-blooded; whales are mammals; therefore whales are warm-blooded.,Every raven Ive observed is noisy; therefore all ravens are noisy.,Cities with more bike lanes seem safer; therefore bike lanes always reduce crashes.,Deduction proceeds from general premises to a conclusion that must be true if the premises are true."
"Which argument is inductive?,Several clinics using a new triage app reported shorter waits; therefore the app reduces wait times everywhere.,From a general law; we derive a necessary consequence.,Several clinics using a new triage app reported shorter waits; therefore the app reduces wait times everywhere.,If triangles have three sides; then polygons with three sides are triangles.,Induction generalizes from specific observations to a broader claim; the conclusion could still be false."
"Which statement best captures Humes problem of induction?,Generalizing from observed to unobserved cases lacks a purely logical guarantee.,Observational data are always biased.,Generalizing from observed to unobserved cases lacks a purely logical guarantee.,Statistical inference solves all uncertainty.,Hume noted that induction lacks a deductive justification."
"According to Popper; a scientific theory should be:,Falsifiablecapable of conflicting with possible observations.,Widely accepted by experts.,Falsifiablecapable of conflicting with possible observations.,Confirmed by many anecdotes.,Poppers demarcation criterion is falsifiability."
"Which practice misapplies falsificationism as described in the chapter?,Formulating a null hypothesis primarily to make rejection likely.,Testing your actual theoretical prediction against risky data.,Formulating a null hypothesis primarily to make rejection likely.,Specifying primary outcomes before analysis.,A straw-man null created mainly to be rejected pays lip service to falsificationism without testing the substantive claim."
"Failing to reject the null hypothesis provides evidence that the null is true.,False,True,False,,Non-significance is not evidence for the null; it may reflect low power or imprecision."
"Rejecting the null hypothesis proves the alternative is true.,False,True,False,,A small p-value indicates data are unlikely under the null; not that a specific alternative is proven."
"Which statement matches the counterfactual notion of causality used in the course?,A causes B if B would not have occurred had A not occurred.,A causes B if they are associated in a sample.,A causes B if B would not have occurred had A not occurred.,A causes B if A is measured first.,Counterfactual causality asks whether the outcome would differ absent the putative cause."
"A survey finds that people who use fitness trackers report better sleep quality. Which interpretation is correct?,The correlation is consistent with causation but also with reverse causation or a third variable (e.g.; health consciousness).,Fitness trackers cause better sleep.,The correlation is consistent with causation but also with reverse causation or a third variable (e.g.; health consciousness).,The correlation proves there is no causal relation.,Correlation is compatible with several causal structures; it does not by itself establish causality."
"Which option correctly lists Mills three conditions for arguing that X causes Y?,Covariation; Temporal precedence; Non-spuriousness,Covariation; Temporal precedence; Non-spuriousness,Large effect size; Random sampling; Low p-value,Temporal precedence; External validity; Reliability,Mills requirements are covariation; temporal precedence; and non-spuriousness."
"Which design best enforces the three conditions for causality?,Randomly assigning classrooms to a new curriculum versus the standard one,Cross-sectional survey of media use and mood,Randomly assigning classrooms to a new curriculum versus the standard one,Observational study of diet and blood pressure,Random assignment supports non-spuriousness; experimental timing enforces temporal precedence; contrasts show covariation."
"In a randomized controlled trial (RCT); random assignment primarily addresses:,Non-spuriousness by making groups comparable in expectation,Covariation by guaranteeing a big effect,Temporal precedence by measuring outcomes first,Non-spuriousness by making groups comparable in expectation,Randomization balances measured and unmeasured causes in expectation; limiting third-variable explanations."
"Observational studies can never contribute to causal claims.,False,True,False,,Observational evidence can inform causal questions when paired with theory and appropriate design/assumptions."
"Ice cream sales and drowning incidents rise together across months. Which explanation violates non-spuriousness?,Temperature increases cause both higher ice cream sales and more swimming (and thus drownings).,Ice cream consumption causes drowning.,Drowning risk causes ice cream purchases.,Temperature increases cause both higher ice cream sales and more swimming (and thus drownings).,A third variable (temperature) drives both variables; creating a spurious association."
"Which pairing matches how deduction and induction appear in hypothesis testing?,Deduction: derive predictions from theory; Induction: generalize from observed data.,Deduction: derive predictions from theory; Induction: generalize from observed data.,Deduction: generalize from data; Induction: derive predictions from theory.,Both terms mean the same thing.,We deduce predictions from theory and induce broader conclusions from data (with appropriate caution)."
