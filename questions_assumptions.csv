Which statement best captures the linearity assumption in OLS regression?,The expected change in the outcome is proportional to changes in each predictor across its range,The predictors must be normally distributed,The outcome must be measured without error,The residuals must have constant variance,Linearity is about the average of Y at each X forming a straight line. The other options describe different assumptions.
Homoscedasticity means:,Residuals have constant variance across all levels of the predicted values,Residuals are centered at zero,Predictors are uncorrelated with each other,Predictors are measured on a continuous scale,Homoscedasticity is constant spread of residuals across the range of fitted values.
A residuals versus predicted plot shows a clear funnel shape. Which assumption is most likely violated?,Homoscedasticity,Linearity,Independence of observations,Normality of predictors,A funnel pattern indicates changing residual variance across fitted values.
Why does normality of residuals matter most for small samples in OLS?,It underpins the accuracy of t tests and confidence intervals for coefficients,It guarantees unbiased slope estimates,It ensures predictors are measured reliably,It eliminates the need to check other assumptions,With small samples inference for slopes uses normality. In large samples asymptotics help.
Your data consist of students nested within classrooms but you fit a single level OLS model that treats all rows as independent. Which assumption is threatened?,Independence of observations,No outliers,Normality of predictors,Correct scale of measurement for the outcome,Clustering creates correlated errors. Rows are not independent.
Two predictors are highly correlated. What is the most common consequence for the regression coefficients?,They become unstable with inflated standard errors and may change sign with small data changes,They become unbiased and more precise,They become systematically too large,They remain unchanged but model fit worsens,High correlation among predictors creates multicollinearity and unstable estimates.
Which outcome variable violates the correct scale of measurement assumption for standard OLS regression?,A binary pass or fail indicator coded 0 and 1,Annual income in dollars,Test score from 0 to 100,Height in centimeters,OLS assumes a continuous outcome. A binary outcome calls for a different model.
What is the typical effect of measurement error in a predictor on its estimated slope in OLS?,Bias toward zero,Bias away from zero,No bias but larger p values,No effect if the outcome is normal,Classical measurement error in X attenuates the slope.
You see a systematic curve in the residuals versus predicted plot. Which assumption is most suspect?,Linearity,Independence,Homoscedasticity,No outliers,A patterned residual plot suggests a wrong functional form. The relation is not linear.
Which statement about outliers and influence in OLS is correct?,A point can be influential if it has unusual predictor values and substantially changes the fitted line,Any point far from the regression line is necessarily highly influential,Only points with extreme outcome values can be influential,Influential points affect p values but never change coefficient signs,Influence depends on leverage and residual. Such points can change slopes and even signs.
