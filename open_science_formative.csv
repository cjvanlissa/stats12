A field reports about 90 percent significant findings while typical study power is about 35 percent. What is the most plausible interpretation?,Publication bias and selective reporting are likely inflating the visible discovery rate,The field studies exceptionally large true effects,The nominal alpha is lower than 0.05 across studies,Replications will usually find larger effects,If average power is about 35 percent then only about 35 percent of studies should be significant even when effects are real. Much higher rates suggest selection on significance and QRPs
Which practice best describes collecting an initial sample then checking results and adding participants until p is below 0.05 without a prespecified stopping rule or correction,Optional stopping without error control,HARKing,Proper sequential design,Publication bias,Peeking and topping up until a threshold inflates the Type I error unless a sequential design with error spending is prespecified
A study measures five outcomes but reports only the one that is significant as the primary outcome while omitting the rest. Which QRP is this,Selective outcome reporting,Flexible data cleaning,Model fishing,Appropriate parsimony,Reporting only significant outcomes increases false positives and overstates effects in the visible record
After inspecting results the authors exclude outliers using a post hoc rule that increases the effect size. Which problem is most salient,Flexible data cleaning that capitalizes on chance,Predefined exclusion criteria,Correct robustness analysis,Registered Report compliance,Data dependent exclusion rules raise false positives and bias estimates
Authors try many plausible models with different covariates and transforms and present only the one that yields p below 0.05. This primarily illustrates,Model fishing,Proper sensitivity analysis,Randomization failure,Correct multiple testing adjustment,Undisclosed multiple testing across specifications inflates the effective Type I error and effect estimates
A moderation effect is described as predicted but the interaction was considered only after seeing the data. What is this called,HARKing,Outcome switching,Optional stopping,Preregistration,Hypothesizing after results are known presents post hoc explanations as if they were a priori predictions
With ten independent tests at alpha equals 0.05 and no adjustment what is the approximate probability of at least one false positive,About 40 percent,About 5 percent,About 10 percent,About 95 percent,The family wise error is 1 minus 0.95 to the power of 10 which is about 0.40
Which statement best captures the purpose of preregistration in this course,Specify key decisions in advance to separate confirmatory from exploratory work and reduce undisclosed flexibility,Prevent all deviations from the plan,Ban exploratory analyses,Guarantee replication success,Preregistration clarifies plans and reduces hidden degrees of freedom. It does not forbid exploration or ensure positive results
Which preregistration description is strongest,Primary outcome PSQI total; hypothesis treatment lowers PSQI versus control; N equals 200 with a fixed stopping rule; exclusions preregistered attention check; analysis linear model with prespecified covariates; alpha equals 0.05; secondary outcomes labeled exploratory,We will analyze outcomes using appropriate models and stop when effects stabilize,We predict positive effects on several variables and will include covariates as needed,We will choose outcomes after data collection to reduce noise,Specific precise and comprehensive plans reduce undisclosed flexibility and clarify confirmatory versus exploratory analyses
Which statement about Registered Reports is accurate,In principle acceptance before data collection commits publication if the approved protocol is followed regardless of outcome,Acceptance depends on obtaining p below 0.05,Methods are reviewed only after results are known,They eliminate the need to share data or code,Registered Reports decouple publication from results and move review upstream to focus on theory and design quality
