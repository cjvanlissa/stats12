"A researcher performs a Z-test to test the hypotheses H0: mu = 0 versus H1: mu > 0. She finds a test statistic of Z = 2.03 and a one-tailed p-value of 0.02. Statement: If the researcher had performed a two-tailed Z-test, the value of the two-tailed p-value would have been halved: 0.01.,FALSE,TRUE,,,""The p-value for a two-tailed test is twice as large as for a one-tailed test (because you have the same one-tailed probability in both tails). For two-tailed tests, if the observed effect is in the direction of the alternative hypothesis, you can half the two-tailed p-value."",,,,,,,,"
"Chris expects that people who have bungee jumped will score high on average on the Big 5 personality trait 'Openness to Experience'. Openness to Experience has been measured on a 10 point scale (1= not at all open, 10 = extremely open). He takes a random sample of 45 persons who have bungee jumped and observes a mean of 6 and SD of 1.954. He tests the following hypotheses: H0: mu =< 5.5 versus H1: mu > 5.5 with a one-sample t-test. He assumes that Openness to Experience is normally distributed in the population. What is the smallest significance level for which Chris can reject the null hypothesis?,0.05,0.1,0.01,Cannot reject H0,""Divide the standard deviation by the square root of 45 to get the standard error. Then, divide the difference between the observed mean of 6 and the hypothesized mean of 5.5 by that standard error to get the test statistic. Then, find the critical t-values for a one-sided test with the three alpha levels mentioned in the answers in the t-distribution for 44 degrees of freedom (n - 1). Note that the answer is .05!"",,,,,,,,"
"What is the purpose of inferential statistics?,Using sample data to infer properties of the population,Estimation of population parameters,Calculating sample statistics,Testing the null hypothesis,""Inferential statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. It allows researchers to make educated guesses about population parameters based on the information collected from the sample. Calculating sample statistics is a step in the inferential process, but it is not the primary purpose of inferential statistics. Testing the null hypothesis is another inferential procedure, but it is a specific type of hypothesis testing, and not the overall purpose of inferential statistics."",,,,,,,,"
What is the standard error?,An estimate of the average sampling error when estimating a population parameter using a sample statistic,The spread of the sample data,An estimate of the uncertainty about the sample statistic,An estimate of the uncertainty about the average of the sample values,The standard error is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the sample statistic as estimator of the population parameter. It represents how much the sample statistic is expected to vary from one sample to another if multiple samples were drawn from the same population.,,,,,,,,
"What is a hypothesis in the context of statistical testing?,A proposition about the population that can be tested in a sample,An explanation for observed phenomena,A statement that some parameter is equal to zero,Something you want to know about the population,""In statistical testing, a hypothesis is a testable proposition about the population that can be examined using sample data. It is a statement or assumption that researchers put to the test to determine if there is evidence to support it or not. The hypothesis is formulated based on the theory or observations made about the population."",,,,,,,,"
"What is meant by 'power' in statistical testing?,The probability of correctly finding a true effect,The probability of committing a Type I error,The probability of committing a Type II error,The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis,""Power in statistical testing refers to the probability of correctly detecting a true effect or relationship between variables. It is the likelihood of finding a significant result in a study when the effect being investigated truly exists in the population. It is important to have sufficient power in a study to avoid false-negative findings, where we fail to reject the null hypothesis when there is a real effect. Power is one minus the probability of committing a Type II error, or 1-beta."",,,,,,,,"
