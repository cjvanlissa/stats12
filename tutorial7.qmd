## Bivariate Regression

Social science students were asked about their opinion towards Tilburg’s nightlife, number of Facebook friends, and some other characteristics. The data are in the SocScSurvey.sav file.


Download the file to your computer and open it in SPSS. 

Suppose researchers are interested in the relationship between personality and social media use. In particular, they want to know if extraversion explains the number of Facebook friends. 

What is the independent variable here? `r mcq(c(answer = "Extraversion", "Facebook friends"))`

Remember that the independent variable is the variable that predicts the other variable (which we call the dependent variable). The dependent variable is influenced by the independent variable (its value depends on the independent variable).
 
Run a regression analysis in which you regress Facebook friends on extraversion (via analyze > regression > linear).

Keep in mind that we "regress the dependent variable Y on the independent variables (X)".

Consult the output.


Write down the estimated unstandardized regression equation.

`r hide("Answer")`

$\text{Friends}_i = -62.377 + 26.788*\text{Extraversion}_i + e_i$

`r unhide()`

Which of the following statements is true?

`r longmcq(c("If Facebook friends increases with one unit, extraversion increases with 26.788 units", answer = "If Extraversion increases with one unit, the number of facebook friends increases with 26.788 units", "If Extraversion increases with 26.788 units, the number of facebook friends increases with 1 unit")[sample.int(3)])` 


Remember that the general form of interpretation of the unstandardized effect is: "If X increases with 1 unit, Y increases/decreases with 'unstandardized regression coefficient' units".
 
What is the value of the standardized regression coefficient? `r fitb(0.438, num = T, tol = .01)`

You can find the standardized regression coefficients in the column called 'Standardized Coefficients Beta'.
 
Which of the following statements about the standardized regression coefficients is correct?

`r longmcq(c("If extraversion increases with one unit, the number of facebook friends increases with 0.438 SDs", "If extraversion increases with one SD, the number of facebook friends increases with 0.438 units", answer = "If extraversion increases with one SD, the number of facebook friends increases with 0.438 SDs")[sample.int(3)])`

Remember that standardized regression coefficients are interpreted in a similar way as unstandardized regression coefficients are, with the one difference being they are interpreted in terms of standard deviations.
 

Consider the first person in the data file. The person had an extraversion score of 9.

What is the predicted number of Facebook friends for this person? `r fitb(179, num = T)`

Consider the first person again.

Given the predicted number of Facebook friends for this person, what is the prediction error (rounded to the nearest integer)? `r fitb(-159, num = TRUE, tol = .1)`

Prediction error = yobserved - ypredicted


Consider two people, one with an extraversion score of 10 and the other with an extraversion score of 15.

What is the difference in the predicted number of Facebook friends between the two persons? (report the absolute value) `r fitb(134, num = T, tol = .1)`


Consult the output of the regression analysis.


What percentage of the total variance in number of Facebook friends can be explained by extraversion? `r fitb(19.2, num = T, tol = .1)`

Consult the ANOVA table.

The table shows the results of an F-test.

What is the default null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for the reported test?

`r hide("Answer")`
$H_0: \rho^2 = 0$, $H_A: \rho^2 > 0$
`r unhide()`

Suppose three researchers test the significance of the R-square.

Researcher I tests at the 10% level, researcher II tests at the 5% level, and researcher III at the 1% level.


Which researcher will reject the null hypothesis? `r mcq(c("Only researcher I", "Only researcher II", "Only researcher III", answer = "All three researchers")[sample.int(4)])` 


When reporting the F-test for the model, you would report $R^2$, the F-test statistic, its degrees of freedom, and the p-value.

The F-test has two distinct degrees of freedom. The first refers to the degrees of freedom for the regression equation, and the second to the degrees of freedom for the residuals. The degrees of freedom are given in brackets. For example, if regression has 2 degrees of freedom and the residuals 100, we write the F-value as F(2,100) = ....

Which of the following F value and corresponding degrees of freedom should be reported? `r mcq(c("F(1,132) = 0.000", answer = "F(1,132) = 31.283", "F(1,133) = 31.283")[sample.int(3)])` 

Keep the output for the next assignment.

In the next assignment we will extend our analysis by including multiple predictors to predict the number of Facebook friends (i.e., we will carry out multiple regression analysis).    

## Multiple Regression

In a previous assignment we predicted Facebook friends by extraversion.

In this question we will add another predictor, peer pressure.

The variable peer pressure refers to the tendency to be influenced by close friends. Higher scores reflect higher sensitivity to peer pressure.

Before we proceed with the regression analysis, we will first look at the correlations between the variables.

Analyze > correlate > bivariate.

Now choose as variables: Facebook Friends, Extraversion and Peer Pressure, and click OK.

What is the correlation between peer pressure and number of Facebook friends? `r fitb(0.145, num = T, tol = .01)`

Suppose three researchers test the significance of the correlation between peer pressure and Facebook friends. Researcher I tests at the 10% level, researcher II tests at the 5% level, and researcher III at the 1% level.


Which researcher will reject the null hypothesis? `r mcq(c(answer = "Only researcher I", "Only researcher II", "Only researcher III", "All three researchers")[sample.int(4)])` 

Now, run the regression analysis in which the number of Facebook friends is regressed on extraversion and peer pressure.

Proceed as follows: via analyze > regression > linear.
Choose Facebook friends as dependent and extraversion and peer pressure as independents.

Consult the output and write down the regression equation.

`r hide("Answer")`
$\text{Friends}_i = -158.012 + 26.560*\text{Extraversion}_i + 12.056*\text{Peer}_i + e_i$

`r unhide()`

Consider the second person in the sample. The person had an extraversion score of 11 and a score of 9 on peer pressure.


What is the predicted number of Facebook friends for this person? `r fitb(242.652, num = T, tol = .1)`

Consult the output.

Researchers conclude that – in the sample – as peer pressure increases with one unit, the predicted number of Facebook friends increases with 12.056 units. 

Is this a valid conclusion? `r mcq(c("Yes", answer = "No"))`

In multiple regression, the regression coefficients show us the expected changes in the dependent variable, while keeping the other independent variables constant.

With this in mind, what is the correct conclusion?

`r longmcq(c(answer = "As peer pressure increases with one unit the predicted number of Facebook friends increases with 12.056 units, while keeping extraversion constant.",
"As peer pressure increases with one unit the predicted number of Facebook friends increases with 12.056 units.",
"As peer pressure increases with one unit the predicted number of Facebook friends increases with 12.056 units, while extraversion changes with 26.56 units.",
"As peer pressure increases with one unit the predicted number of Facebook friends increases with 12.056 units. This is added to the constant of -158.01.")[sample.int(4)])`

Consult the table Coefficients. The table shows the results of t-tests. 

What are the null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses that are tested here? 

`r hide("Answer")`
The t-tests test significance of the individual regression coefficients. In particular, for each coefficient we can use the t-tests to test the following hypotheses:

$H_0: \beta = 0$, $H_1: \beta \ne 0$
`r unhide()`

What is the value of the test-statistic for the significance test for extraversion? `r fitb(5.583, num = TRUE, tol = .01)`


Consider the t-tests for the regression coefficients again.

How many degrees of freedom do the t-tests have? `r fitb(131, num = T)`

`r hide("Explanation")`
Note that:

Degrees of freedom = N - p
N = number of participants; p = number of parameters in the model (intercept + two regression slopes)
`r unhide()`
 

Suppose three researchers test the significance of peer pressure as a predictor of Facebook friends, while controlling for extraversion. Researcher I tests at the 10% level, researcher II tests at the 5% level, and researcher III at the 1% level.


Which researcher(s) will reject the null hypothesis? `r mcq(c(answer = "Only researcher I", "Only researcher II", "Only researcher III", "All three researchers")[sample.int(4)])` 
    


What *percentage* of the total variance in Facebook friends can be explained by both extraversion and peer pressure? `r fitb(20.9, num = T, tol = .1)`

Compare the $R^2$ of the regression model with both predictors with the $R^2$ of a model with only extraversion as the predictor.

What is the difference? `r fitb(0.017, num = T, tol = .01)`

In the previous step we compared the $R^2$ of two so called nested models. 

Two models are nested if the larger model (i.e., the model with the most predictors) contains all predictors of the smaller model.

In the next lecture we will learn more about nested models, model comparisons, and how useful they are for researchers! 


## Multiple Regression II

For this assignment we need the file HealthyFood.sav.

This file contains hypothetical data on three variables:

Eating healthy food (the higher the score, the healthier a person's diet)
Knowledge about food (the higher the score, the more a person knows about healthy food and risks of unhealthy food)
Income (higher scores = more income).
 
Let's first look at the associations (correlations) between the three variables.

Compute the correlations and summarize the relationships between all pairs of variables. Include in your answer the strength of the relationship (i.e., weak, moderate, or strong), the direction of the relationship (i.e., positive or negative), and generalizability to the population (i.e., is the correlation significant at the 5% level).

Cohen’s rules of thumb:

* r = 0.00-0.30 (none to weak)
* r = 0.30-0.50 (weak to moderate)
* r = 0.50-0.70 (moderate to strong)
* r = 0.70-0.90 (strong to very strong)
* r = 0.90-1.00 (very strong)

`r hide("Answer")`

- Income and eating have a weak positive correlation, which is significant at the 5% level.
- Income and knowledge have a weak to moderate positive correlation, which is significant at the 5% level.
- Knowledge and eating have a moderate to strong positive correlation, which is significant at the 5% level.

Researchers may be interested in explaining differences in eating healthy food: in other words, they want to know why some people eat very healthy, while others tend to eat unhealthy. 

One of the hypotheses is that healthy food is on average more expensive than unhealthy food, so one of the explanatory variables may be income.


Run a regression analysis using eating as the dependent variable and income as the independent variable. 

Consult the output.


Which of the following conclusions is correct?

`r longmcq(c(answer = "The effect of Income on eating healthy food is positive and significantly different from zero.","The effect of Income on eating healthy food is positive but not significantly different from zero."))`
 
Simple regression analysis suggests a positive relationship between income and healthy food.

However, other researchers (say Team B) came up with an alternative explanation. They hypothesized that the relationship between income and healthy food can be explained by a confounder; knowledge. People with more knowledge will have better jobs (on average), and, as a result more, income. As the result of their knowledge they also prefer to eat healthy food. I.e., Team B thinks knowledge is a common cause of income and eating healthy food.


In other words, the researchers of Team B hypothesize that the relationship between income and eating healthy food is `r mcq(c("Indirect", answer = "Spurious"))`

Draw (on a piece of paper) the conceptual model that reflects the hypotheses of the researchers.

`r hide("Answer")`

`r unhide()`


Now let's see if the data support the hypotheses of the researchers.

Run a multiple regression analysis using eating healthy food as the dependent variable and income and knowledge as independent variables.

Consult the output. Look at the effect of income, controlled for knowledge (both the coefficient and the significance test).

- What happened with the effect of income if you control for knowledge?
- Does knowledge predict eating healthy food (controlled for income)? 
- Do the data support the hypothesis that the relationship between income and healthy food is confounded by knowledge?

What is the p-value of Income when you control for Knowledge? `r fitb(.778, num = T, tol = .01)`

What is the p-value of Knowledge, controlling for Income? `r fitb(.001, num = T, tol = .01)`

Do the data support the hypothesis that the relationship between income and healthy food is confounded by knowledge? `r mcq(c(answer = "Yes", "No"))`


Finally, interpret the output. Write down the answers to the following questions:

1. How well can we predict the variance in healthy eating with the predictors income and knowledge? Interpret R2, report the appropriate test and its significance
1. Interpret the regression coefficients (size, direction, significance)
1. Which predictor is the most important predictor of healthy eating behavior? Inspect the standardized regression coefficients

`r hide("Answer")`


Income and Knowledge together predict 44.9% of the variance in Eating healthy food, which is significantly different from zero, $R^2 = .45, F(2, 347) = 141.179, p <.001$.

Controlling for Knowledge, Income has a positive, but non-significant effect on Eating healthy food, t(347) = .283, p = .778.

Controlling for Income, Knowledge has a positive, significant effect on Eating healthy food, t(347) = 15.287, p <.001.

Knowledge is the most important predictor (β = .665) (compare it with β = .012 of Income).
