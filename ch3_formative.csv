answer,question,A,B,C,D,explanation
X and Y tend to rise together,A covariance of +120 cm·kg tells you…,A perfect linear trend,X and Y tend to rise together,120 % of Y variance explained,The units have been standardised,Positive sign = same-direction movement; magnitude is unit-dependent so strength not directly interpretable.
Longer study → lower stress,"If the covariance between study hours and stress level is negative, what does that imply?",Longer study → higher stress,Longer study → lower stress,No relationship,Units are incomparable,Negative covariance means high X pairs with low Y and vice‑versa.
Its size depends on measurement units,Which statement about covariance magnitude is true?,It ranges only from –1 to +1,A larger value always means a stronger relationship,Its size depends on measurement units,It equals the regression slope,Rescaling either variable rescales covariance; therefore magnitude alone is not comparable across units.
Increase by a constant factor,Converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit will make the covariance between temperature and ice-cream sales…,Stay exactly the same,Increase by a constant factor,Switch sign,Become unit‑free,Multiplying Celsius by 1.8 and adding 32 rescales covariance by 1.8; adding a constant does not affect it.
Standardised (unit-free) covariance,Pearson’s r is best described as…,Raw measure of joint variability,Standardised (unit-free) covariance,Mean of X and Y combined,Ratio of two variances,Dividing covariance by the product of SDs removes units and bounds the result between –1 and +1.
No linear relationship is present,"If r = 0, we can conclude that…",X and Y are unrelated in every way,No linear relationship is present,X causes Y,The data contain no outliers,r only detects linear association; other patterns may still exist.
The variables move together only slightly,A positive covariance but r ≈ 0.05 usually indicates that…,The relationship is strong,The variables move together only slightly,Units have been standardised,Data range is restricted to zero,Small r means weak linear association despite positive sign.
Overall slope direction,Which scatter‑plot feature primarily determines the sign of covariance (and r)?,Point density,Overall slope direction,Presence of a mode,Sample size,Positive slope → positive sign; negative slope → negative sign.
Covariance × 10; r unchanged,You multiply every X score by 10 but leave Y unchanged. What happens?,Covariance unchanged; r × 10,Covariance × 10; r × 10,Covariance × 10; r unchanged,Both covariance and r unchanged,Scaling one variable scales covariance by that factor but leaves r (unit‑free) unchanged.
Their linear relationship (r) is 0,A covariance of 0 implies that…,X and Y are unrelated in every way,Their linear relationship (r) is 0,They have opposite scales,X causes Z,Zero covariance means no linear co‑movement; nonlinear links could still exist.
X and Y are associated; causal direction unknown,Two variables show r = 0.85. Which conclusion is justified?,X causes Y,Y causes X,X and Y are associated; causal direction unknown,A third variable is impossible,Correlation quantifies association but cannot establish causality without experimental control.
Smaller in magnitude,Analysing data with a restricted range typically makes r…,Larger in magnitude,Smaller in magnitude,Change sign,Exactly zero,"Less variability reduces covariance relative to the SDs, shrinking r."
Inflate the magnitude of r,An extreme outlier that follows the overall trend will most likely…,Drive r toward zero,Inflate the magnitude of r,Make covariance negative,Remove measurement error,"Trend‑consistent outliers add leverage, increasing |r|."
49 % of Y variance is explained by X,A coefficient of determination (r²) of 0.49 means that…,49 % of X variance is explained by Y,49 % of Y variance is explained by X,The correlation is −0.70,Covariance is unit‑free,r² translates correlation into variance‑explained terms.
Pearson’s r,"After converting both X and Y to z‑scores, the covariance of those z‑variables equals…",Always zero,Sample size,Pearson’s r,Their geometric mean,"Standardising divides by SDs, so covariance in z‑space equals r."
