## Probability, Odds, and Logits

We will start this session on logistic regression with some theoretical exercises. This way, you will learn how to work with probability, odds, and logits.
 
The given probability is P = 0.36.

What are the corresponding odds? `r fitb(0.563, num = T, tol = .01)`

Please find the formula’s below:

Goal | Function
-----|----------
Probability -> Odds | $odds = P/(1-P)$
Odds -> Probability | $P = odds/(1+Odds)$
Odds -> Logit | $logit = \ln(odds)$
Logit -> Odds | $odds = e^{logit}$

 

Again, the given probability is P = 0.36.

What are the corresponding logits? `r fitb(-0.575, num = T, tol = .01)`

The given logit is – 2.7.

What are the corresponding odds? `r fitb(0.067, num = T, tol = .01)`


Again, the given logit is – 2.7. `r fitb(0.063, num = T, tol = .01)`



Discuss with your group mates when and why we should carry out logistic regression analysis.

`r hide("Explanation")`

We carry out logistic regression analysis when we want to carry out regression analysis and we have a dichotomous outcome variable (i.e., a dependent variable with two answer categories). In that case we cannot use linear regression because several of the assumptions of linear regression are violated.

In a study concerning the smoking behavior amongst adolescents, a logistic regression analysis is conducted to check the effect of the image of smoking (Image) on smoking behavior (Smoking).

Image: to what degree the young adult thinks smoking is perceived as “cool”.
The variable image is measured on a scale from 10 to 30, in which higher scores indicate that smoking is perceived as cooler.

Smoking: whether or not the adolescent smokes.

* 0 = the adolescent is a non-smoker
* 1 = the adolescent is a smoker
 

Below you can find part of the output the researchers retrieved.

![](images/Figure 5-2.png)

First, write down the estimated regression model.

`r hide("Answer")`


$Logit(Smoking = 1) = -5.65 + 0.28*Image$
 
`r unhide()`

What is the probability that an adolescent with a score of 15 on image smokes? `r fitb(0.33, num = T, tol = .01)`
 
Take a look at the regression coefficient.

![](images/Figure 5-1-1.png)

Imagine that one's score on Image will increase from 15 to 16.

To what degree will the logit and odds change?

And what can you conclude about the increase in probability?



`r hide("Answer")`
The logit increases with 0.284. So −1.387+0.284=−1.103

The odds increase with a factor 1.328. So, the odds become 0.25×1.328=0.332

By just looking at the output, it is unclear what *exactly* will happen with the probability. We DO know that the probability will increase because the logits and the odds increase.

If we would calculate the probability by hand, we would see that the probability increases with 0.05.

`r unhide()`

As you can see, the logit follows a linear function, the odds follow an exponential function, and probability follows a logistic function (perhaps less clear from the example but see the graphs below for an illustration). It is nice to work with a linear model (i.e., work with the logits), but from an interpretation point of view odds and probabilities are nicer to work with.

## Logistic Regression

Today we will study whether the probability to pass a Statistics course depends on exam fear and the math grade obtained in high school (prior math ability).

Open LAS BE LR.sav.

In the table below you find the variables included in this fictional data set.


We want to study the following research question:

Does the probability of passing the statistics exam depend on exam stress and math ability?

To answer this question, we first need to dichotomize the dependent variable. 
This is an unusual step, because dichotomizing variables loses information!
Still, for the purpose of the present exercise, we will do so.
We will create the new dependent variable Passed (0 = fail, 1 = pass), where a 5.5 or higher counts as a pass. Use the following steps:

Navigate to Transform → Recode into different variables.
Select GradeStats as input variable and use Passed as the name for the new recoded variable. Do not forget to click on CHANGE.
Click on Old and new values and specify the recoding in such a way that all grades of 5.5 or higher will get the new value 1 and all grades lower than 5.5 (i.e., all other grades) the value 0.
Paste and run the syntax.
Go to variable view and specify the value labels.
 

Obtain the frequency distribution for Passed (via Analyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Frequencies).

What percentage of students passed? `r fitb(82.2, num = T, tol = .2)`%


We will use logistic regression to study the effect of exam stress and math ability on the probability to pass. Take the following steps:

Navigate to Analyze --> Regression --> Binary logistic regression
Select Passed as dependent variable and ExamStress and Math as independent variables (in SPSS called “covariates”).
Paste and run the syntax.
 


Inspect the output corresponding to Block 1. Take a look at the table “Variables in the Equation”.

What would be good description of the effects on the sample level? (i.e., what the effect of ExamStress and Math on the probability to pass looks like).

`r hide("Answer")`
Turns out Exam Stress has a negative effect on the probability to pass (controlled for Math grade), and Math a positive effect (controlled for Exam Stress). 
 
`r unhide()`

What is the value of the regression coefficient for the variable Exam Stress? `r fitb(-0.025, num = T, tol =0.005)`
 


Give a detailed interpretation of this number.

`r hide("Answer")`

If we would increase one unit in Exam Stress the logits to pass the exam will decrease with 0.025, while keeping the variable Math constant.
 
`r unhide()`

True or false: The independent variables Math and Exam Stress together have a significant effect on the probability to pass. `r torf(TRUE)`

`r hide("Explanation")`

When we inspect the model test, we see that, together, Exam Stress and Math grade have a significant effect on the probability to pass, χ2(2) = 81.043, p < .001.
`r unhide()` 

Second, carry out the significance tests for the individual predictors as well.

True or false: There is a significant effect of Math on the probability to pass, controlled for Exam stress. `r torf(TRUE)`

True or false: There is a significant effect of Exam stress on the probability to pass, controlled for Math. `r torf(FALSE)`

`r hide("Explanation")`

When we inspect the separate regression coefficients together, we see that:

Controlled for Exam stress, Math grade has a significant effect on the probability to pass, χ2(1)=54.500, p<.001.
Controlled for Math grade, Exam stress has no significant effect on the probability to pass, χ2(1)=0.040, p=.841.
 
`r unhide()`

## Logistic Regression with Categorical Predictor

Now, we will carry out a logistic regression analysis to study whether the probability to pass can be predicted from the amount of preparation (Preparation), controlled for prior math ability (Math).

But... the variable Preparation is a nominal (categorical) variable. Use dummy coding to include it in the model. The variable Preparation has three categories. Create all three dummy variables!

Take the following approach to carry out the analysis.

Navigate to Analyze --> Regression --> Binary Logistic

Select Math as covariate.

Select the dummies for Preparation as covariates. At this stage, use “only reading the book” as the reference group.

Paste and run the syntax.
 

Take a look at the table Variables in the Equation.


Inspect the estimated regression coefficients. Consider the results on the sample level, ignoring inferential statistics for now.

Which group has the highest estimated probability to pass? `r mcq(c(answer = "Students who read the book and did the exercises.", "Student who only read the book.", "Students who only did the exercises.")[sample.int(3)])` 
 

Which group has the lowest estimated probability to pass (controlled for math ability)? `r mcq(c(answer =  "Student who only read the book.", "Students who read the book and did the exercises.", "Students who only did the exercises.")[sample.int(3)])` 

Write down the full model equation, filling in the values of coefficients. Then check your answer.

`r hide("Answer")`
$logit_{passed} = -5.833 + .300*D_{exercises} + .946*D_{both} + .999 * Math$



`r unhide()`
 
Controlled for Math Grade, what is the difference in predicted odds between people who only read the book and people who read the book and made the exercises? `r fitb(2.576, num = T, tol = .01)`


`r hide("Explanation")`
Take the exponent of the regression coefficient for the dummy for people who read the book and made the exercises (see table).
`r unhide()`
 

By hand, calculate the probability that the third person in the file (respID=3) passes the exam. `r fitb(0.752, num = T, tol = .01)`
 

Imagine that you do not know whether this person passed the exam or not.

True or false: Based on your answer in the previous step and using a decision threshold of .5, you would predict this student to pass. `r torf(TRUE)`


SPSS can easily calculate the probability to pass. 

Either use the visual interface: 

Click on the SAVE button in the menu for logistic regression.

Select Probabilities under the header Predicted Values.

Click on continue.

Or add this line of code to your model:

```
  /SAVE=PRED
```

SPSS adds a new variable to the data file, which gives the predicted probability for each person. Check whether you calculated the predicted probability for person 3 correctly.

 

Imagine that we would have used this model to predict the probability to pass for the students in this sample before they even made the exam. Use a decision threshold of .5 to classify students as those likely to pass vs fail. 

Out of all students that were classified as "pass", which proportion actually failed? `r fitb(0.141, num = T, tol = .01)`

`r hide("Explanation")`
Of the 370 students who were predicted to pass, 52 failed the exam (.141). As you can see, the model is not completely flawless in making predictions.
 
`r unhide()`

What is worse in your opinion? Incorrectly predicting that students will pass (when they end up failing), or incorrectly predicting that students will fail (when they end up passing)? Why?

If you chose a different decision criteria to predict passing - say .7, what would happen to the proportion of students that were classified as "pass", but actually failed? `r mcq(c(answer = "gets smaller", "gets bigger", "stays the same", "can't say")[sample.int(4)])`


## Hierarchical Logistic Regression

In this assignment we will compare the following two models against each other.

* Model1: $Logit(Pass) = b0+b1∗Math$
* Model2: $Logit(Pass) = b0+b1∗Math+b2∗ExamStress+b3∗Evaluation$

Later on, we want to carry out a model comparison test to check whether the larger model predicts the probability of passing the exam better than the smaller model.

What would be the regression df for the model comparison test, in which we compare the larger model 2 to the smaller model 1? `r fitb(2, num = T)`

Now we will carry out the model comparison test. Take the following steps.

Navigate to Analyze -> Regression -> Binary Logistic

Select Math as predictor (covariates).

Click on Next (upper right); we can now indicate which block of predictors we like to add in addition to the variables added in the first model.

Enter ExamStress and Evaluation as predictors (covariates).

Paste and run the syntax.
 

Inspect the output. SPSS organizes the output in three blocks. The results in Block 0 refer to the null model without any predictors. Note that this null model also exists when you use the "Linear Regression" interface, but it's not featured in the output.

Block 1 refers to the results of Model 1 and Block to the results of Model 2.
 

Take a look at the results of the model comparison test. 

What test statistic is used to compare nested logistic regression models? `r mcq(c(answer = "Chi squared", "F", "t", "Z")[sample.int(4)])`

What is the value of the appropriate test statistic for comparing models 1 and 2? `r fitb(1.297, num = T, tol = .01)`

True or false: Adding predictors ExamStress and Evaluation lead to significantly better predictions, compared to a model with only high school math grade as predictor. `r torf(FALSE)`
