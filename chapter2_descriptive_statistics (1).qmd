Most research projects begin with a simple but urgent question: **“What do my data look like?”**  
Before modelling, testing, or drawing any bold conclusions, we need a clear picture of the raw numbers in front of us. Descriptive statistics give us that picture. They condense dozens, hundreds, or even millions of observations into a handful of carefully chosen summaries that answer two core questions:

* Where is the **centre** of the distribution?  
* How much **variation** is there around that centre?

With those answers in hand we can decide whether the data meet the expectations of later analyses and communicate their basic features to any reader—specialist or not.

## What Do We Mean by a *Statistical Model*? {#sec-model}

A statistical model is a *story* about how data come to be.  
In its simplest form the story says:

> **observed value = systematic part + random part**

The systematic part (sometimes called the *signal*) captures the regularities we hope to explain; the random part (*noise*) captures everything else. Descriptive statistics provide our first, rough estimate of both pieces:

* a single number that best represents *all* observations (signal), and  
* a measure of how far, on average, individual observations stray from that number (noise).

## Finding the Centre: Measures of Central Tendency {#sec-central}

### Mean

Think of the mean as the *balance point* of the distribution—if every observation were a weight on a seesaw, the mean is where the plank would level out. It uses *every* score in the dataset, which makes it very informative but also sensitive to extreme values.

### Median  

Imagine lining all observations up from the smallest to the largest and picking the one exactly in the middle. Half the data lie below this value and half above. Because it depends only on order, not distance, the median resists the pull of outliers and skewed tails.

### Mode  

The mode is simply the most frequently occurring value—or, for categorical variables, the category with the highest count. It is often reported alongside the mean or median and is the only legitimate “centre” when the data are purely nominal (e.g., favourite colour, yes/no choices).

## Gauging the Spread: Measures of Variability {#sec-variability}

A measure of centre tells us *what is typical*, but not *how typical*. To capture that second idea we need an index of dispersion.

### Range  

The quickest check: subtract the smallest value from the largest. Useful for a rough sense of scale but unstable because it depends on just two observations.

### Standard Deviation (and Its Companion, Variance)  

The standard deviation translates the abstract idea of “average distance from the mean” into the same units as the data themselves—years, euros, reaction‑time milliseconds, and so on. A *small* standard deviation means most observations huddle close to the centre; a *large* one means they fan out.

> **A note on computation:** the way we calculate variance and standard deviation differs slightly between a full population and a sample. We will step through those formulas—and the rationale for the famous *n – 1* correction—in the Lecture 2 walkthrough.

## Why Descriptives Matter {#sec-bridge}

* **Data cleaning** – Unusual values leap out when you know the typical range.  
* **Choice of analyses** – Skewed distributions or heavy tails might nudge us toward robust or non‑parametric methods.  
* **Transparency** – Readers can only judge your results if they see the headline features of the raw data.  
* **Communication** – “Participants averaged *just under 9 hours of screen time per day* (SD ≈ 1 hr)” immediately paints a picture.

In short, descriptive statistics are not the boring prelude to “real” analysis—they *are* analysis, and everything else builds on them.

*Lecture 2 will turn these ideas into action: we will compute and visualise descriptive measures in R, explore what happens when we tweak individual scores, and practice writing concise, publication‑ready summaries.*
