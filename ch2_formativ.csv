Which measure of central tendency is robust against extreme outliers?,Median,Mean,Mode,Weighted mean,The median depends only on rank order; extreme values cannot pull it up or down.
"For purely nominal data (e.g., eye color), the only valid measure of central tendency is the:",Mode,Mean,Median,Geometric mean,"Nominal categories lack numerical distance, so the most frequent category (mode) is the only appropriate centre."
The range summarises spread by using:,Only the minimum and maximum,Every score in the set,Only scores below the mean,Squared deviations,"Range is computed as X_max and X_min, relying solely on the two extreme scores."
Squaring deviations when computing variance ensures that:,All deviations contribute positively to variability,Positive and negative deviations cancel,Deviations stay in original units,Variance must be unbiased,"Squares turn all deviations positive, preventing positive and negative differences from cancelling out."
"Adding a constant (e.g., +5) to every score will:","Shift the mean up by 5, leave SD unchanged",Shift SD up by 5,Multiply SD by 5,Not affect the mean,A constant shift moves the centre but does not change the spread of scores.
Multiplying every score by 3 will:,Multiply both mean and SD by 3,Shift the mean by 3,Leave SD unchanged,Divide SD by 3,Scaling stretches both centre and dispersion by the same factor.
"The ""degrees of freedom"" for the sample variance (n-1) reflect that:",One piece of information is already used to estimate the mean,One piece of information is used to estimate the variance,Only n-1 scores are valid,The sample size is unknown,"After fixing the sample mean, only n-1 unique pieces of information remain."
"When a distribution is strongly right-skewed (e.g., income), which  measure of central tendency best represents a typical observation?",Median,Mode,Range,Mean,The median is unaffected by the long tail of extreme high values.
A distribution with two distinct peaks is called:,Bimodal,Unimodal,Skewed,Symmetric,Two modes (peaks) indicate a bimodal distribution.
Reporting the standard deviation alongside the mean helps readers understand:,How tightly scores cluster around the mean,The sample size,The measurement units,If there are outliers,"SD converts variance back to original units, expressing average distance from the mean."
