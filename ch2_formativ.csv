Which measure of centre is robust against extreme outliers?,Median,Median,Mean,Mode,Weighted mean,The median depends only on rank order; extreme values cannot pull it up or down.
"For purely nominal data (e.g., eye‑colour), the only valid measure of central tendency is the…",Mode,Mean,Median,Mode,Geometric mean,"Nominal categories lack numerical distance, so the most frequent category (mode) is the only appropriate centre."
The range summarises spread by using…,Only the minimum and maximum,Every score in the set,Only the minimum and maximum,Only scores below the mean,Squared deviations,"Range is computed as X_max – X_min, relying solely on the two extreme scores."
Squaring deviations when computing variance ensures that…,All deviations contribute positively to variability,Positive and negative deviations cancel,Deviations stay in original units,All deviations contribute positively to variability,Variance must be unbiased,"Squares turn all deviations positive, preventing positive and negative differences from cancelling out."
"Adding a constant (e.g., +5) to every score will…","Shift the mean up by 5, leave SD unchanged","Shift the mean up by 5, leave SD unchanged",Shift SD up by 5,Multiply SD by 5,Not affect the mean,A constant shift moves the centre but does not change the spread of scores.
Multiplying every score by 3 will…,Multiply both mean and SD by 3,Shift the mean by 3,Multiply both mean and SD by 3,Leave SD unchanged,Divide SD by 3,Scaling stretches both centre and dispersion by the same factor.
“Degrees of freedom” for sample variance (n – 1) reflect that…,One piece of information (the mean) is already estimated,The sample size is unknown,One piece of information (the mean) is already estimated,Variance must be unbiased,Only n – 1 scores are valid,"After fixing the sample mean, only n – 1 deviations can vary independently."
"When a distribution is strongly right‑skewed (e.g., income), which centre measure best represents a “typical” observation?",Median,Mean,Median,Mode,Mid‑range,The median is unaffected by the long tail of extreme high values.
A histogram with two distinct high peaks is called…,Bimodal,Unimodal,Bimodal,Skewed,Symmetric,Two modes (peaks) indicate a bimodal distribution.
Reporting the standard deviation alongside the mean helps readers understand…,How tightly scores cluster around the mean,The sample size,The measurement units,How tightly scores cluster around the mean,Whether data are normally distributed,"SD converts variance back to original units, expressing average distance from the mean."
The squared correlation (r²) plays a role for dispersion similar to which single‑variable statistic?,Variance,Variance,Range,Inter‑quartile range,Mode,"Just as variance is the squared SD, r² expresses variance in Y accounted for by X."
The inter‑quartile range (IQR) is especially useful because it…,Ignores extreme tails and focuses on the middle 50 %,Uses every score,Is expressed in squared units,Ignores extreme tails and focuses on the middle 50 %,Requires the mean first,"IQR spans Q3 – Q1, removing the influence of extreme outliers."
